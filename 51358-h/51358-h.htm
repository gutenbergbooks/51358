<h2><a id="PREFATORY"></a>PREFATORY.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Printing</span> has been styled “The telescope of
the soul.” As the optical instrument brings
near and magnifies objects remote and invisible, so
printing puts us in communication with minds of
the past and present, and preserves the thoughts
of this age for future generations.</p>

<p>But no one of the good and great of the past was
permitted to lead the way in embodying thought on
the printed page, save the wonderful man sketched
in this volume. Out of a full heart of reverence,
then, it is most fitting to embalm the memory of
Gutenberg.</p>

<p>While musing on certain old archives touching
the history of printing, it was suggested by literary
friends, that we weave a memorial narrative of the
chevalier and artisan honored in bringing the art to
light. Accordingly we engaged in the work, having
culled the most authentic warp and woof within
reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
Devised in the quiet of old libraries, and in the
hush of peace, our little history finds itself heralded
by the march of armies, and the clash of empires.
War, ever to be deplored as the author
of almost unmingled evil, has turned attention to
the cradles of printing,&mdash;Strasbourg and Mentz.
Directly we recognize them, shake hands, and are
at home with those glorious old Rhenish cities,
made famous for all time.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that the final completion
of the world-famed Minster or Cathedral of Strasbourg,
closely preludes the time when the art of
printing had its rise. Earth’s loftiest spire may
well mark the place where Heaven gave the greatest
treasure-art to man.</p>

<p>Pains have been taken to harmonize the accounts
of early printing by various credible authors, and
when in doubt from conflicting statements, for
safety and defense, we have taken shelter under
the wings of the encyclopædias.</p>

<p>Led on by the romance of the broken betrothal,
and afterwards most happy marriage, we love to
linger over the art devised and cherished in the
sanctity of the inventor’s home. Nobly did the
Lady Anna exercise her “right” and to her,
almost equally with her husband, are we indebted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v">v</a></span>
since she cheered his way, inspiring courage in his
work.</p>

<p>In a cell of St. Arbogast, our hero found a quiet
retreat for some of his secret experiments; never
was an old ruin turned to better account. The
Library and Scriptorium of the great Cathedral
also paid tribute to this man’s genius. But magnificent
things were accomplished in Mentz, after
his unparalleled overthrow in Strasbourg. “Organizing
victory out of defeat,” he took into partnership
the two men of the time best fitted for the
purpose, and engaged anew in his chosen vocation.
One is startled at the sequel of this fraternal alliance
in the estrangement of those so knit together
in pursuit and interest; but the stupendous enterprise
of the firm, and the stricken man mysteriously
“betrayed in the house of his friends,” were alike
upheld by an Unseen Hand.</p>

<p>His persistence and noble purpose in inventing&mdash;how
infinitely more worthy of a place on immortal
records than are the deeds of the warrior!</p>

<p>The design of our work allows only a brief
sketch of the progress of the art subsequent to the
days of Gutenberg.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to note that certain ladies early
engaged in the ennobling employment, and for
many years won golden opinions.</p>

<p>Strasbourg and its Cathedral.&mdash;Gutenberg’s Early Life.&mdash;Civil
Strife.&mdash;Romantic Lawsuit.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Who</span> has not heard of the noble Rhine, which
winds many hundred miles through Central
Europe? Castles, vineyards, farms, and forests,
with now and then a village or a city, diversify its
banks.</p>

<p>Prominent among its cities is Strasbourg; a
strongly fortified border town, founded ages ago by
the Romans, but held recently by France. It was
an imperial city of the German empire in 1681,
when Louis XIV. got possession of it, by an unwarrantable
attack in a time of peace. It is in
shape a triangle, with walls six miles in circuit,
entered by seven gates. The fortifications extend
to the Rhine, although the main city, of 85,000
inhabitants, is situated a mile and a half back on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Ill, a branch of the Rhine. The tourist, while still
far distant, sees the spire of the famous Cathedral,
Nôtre Dame. It is the highest spire in the world,
a masterpiece of airy open-work, of elaborate
tracery and delicate workmanship, towering aloft
four hundred and sixty-six feet, twenty-four feet
higher than the great Pyramid of Egypt, and more
than twice as high as Bunker Hill Monument. The
great Minster of which it is a part, was nine hundred
years in building, and was finished shortly
before our story begins. When the late war came,
the Rhine, Strasbourg, and its Cathedral, were not
wholly unlike what they were at that time,&mdash;four
hundred and thirty-five years ago. It is true, railroad
trains would shriek on either side of the river,
and gaudy steamers bustle up and down, and occasionally
a “water-cure” or a “juvenile reformatory”
meet the eye, signs of modern progress; but
in strange contrast with these the Roman and
mediæval remains. Rhineland is at once ancient
and modern. Here are “ruins of the Middle Ages,
and marks of the French Revolution; the bones of
great feudal giants, and scars of modern disturbance.”
The old homes of the warlike barons still
stand, and the incense-flavored churches, whose
corner-stones were laid in the dim past.</p>

<p>It is in the year 1436; and the visitor, if he
approaches the city from the French side, before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
entering the west gate will be sure to seek out
John Gutenberg, a noted man who lives in the
suburbs in yonder pretty cottage, half hidden in ivy
and honeysuckle, and the ancient turrets of St.
Arbogast Monastery, not a stone’s throw distant,
frowning upon it. There is a woman of taste
within; the well-trained vines speak of her, as do
the tulips and wall-flowers. And the eye glances
admiringly from these to the apple-trees, with their
wealth of blossoms, and the lilacs, jubilant with
plumes.</p>

<p>Gutenberg was born at Mentz, a free and rich
city on the Rhine, about the year 1400, and, when
yet a young man, fled, on account of political dissensions,
to Strasbourg, sixty miles distant. Of his
childhood little is known; yet some German and
other writers draw pleasing pictures of his youth.
They represent him as high-spirited, thoughtful, and
devout; influenced by a desire that good books
might be made common, and as having “a foreseeing
consciousness” of the part he was to act in
bringing it about. “He said to himself, from his
earliest years,” says one of his biographers, “God
suffers in the great multitudes whom his sacred
word cannot reach. Religious truth is captive in a
small number of manuscript books, which guard the
common treasure, instead of diffusing it. Let us
break the seal which holds the holy things; give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
wings to the truth, that by means of speech, no
longer written at great expense by the hand that
wearies itself, but multiplied as the air by an unwearied
machine, it may fly to seek every soul born
into the world!”</p>

<p>If this was true of Gutenberg while young, no
wonder that his manhood was crowned so gloriously.
He placed before himself at the outset a great and
worthy object; he felt through life the thrill of an
inspiring purpose, which stimulated and ennobled his
nature, and tended naturally to success. Had he,
like thousands, been contented to drift through the
world with the current wherever it chanced to bear
him, living for himself and the fleeting present,
never should we have heard of John Gutenberg.</p>

<p>But there is a fact in Gutenberg’s early history
which does not seem to present him in an amiable
light, as he figures in a lawsuit, having been sued
by the father of his betrothed, to compel him to fulfill
his promise of marriage. There is, however,
no evidence that Gutenberg intended any wrong in
this affair, as he sincerely loved Anna von Isernen
Thür,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> the young lady to whom he was engaged.
She was of noble family, of the city of Strasbourg.
His property had been confiscated in Mentz in the
struggle between the plebeians and the nobility, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
his failure in keeping his troth is attributed to his
sensitiveness to his misfortunes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Family name, it is said, from the possession of a feudal castle
on the heights of the Rhine.</p></div>

<p>It has been remarked, that if Mentz, Gutenberg’s
native place, had not been a free city, he might not
have conceived or executed his invention; for despotism,
like superstition, imposes silence. “It was
fitting that printing and liberty should be born of
the same sun and the same air.” Mentz, Strasbourg,
Worms, and other municipal cities of the Rhine,
were small federative republics; as Florence,
Genoa, Venice, and the republics of Italy. The
youth of our country find freedom favorable to
thought and invention; thus young Gutenberg
found it. Yet civil strife marked the history of
those cities. “In them were the warlike nobility,
the aspiring burghers, and the laboring people, who
floated between these two contending classes, alternately
caressed and oppressed by them, yet at times
themselves striving for the supremacy. In these
commotions, victory rested sometimes with the patrician,
sometimes with the plebeian, and numbers
on either side were from time to time outlawed.
But these had not the sea to cross to fly the country;
they traversed the Rhine. Those banished from
Strasbourg, went to Mentz; those from Mentz, to
Strasbourg, to await a turn of events, or the recall
of the exiles.”</p>

<p>In these intestine quarrels, young Gutenberg,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
himself of the nobility, “and naturally combating
for the cause most holy in the eyes of a son, that
of a father,” was twice vanquished and expelled
by the burghers, with all the chevaliers of the family,&mdash;his
mother and sisters being permitted to
remain in possession of their property. Later, the
free city of Frankfort offering to mediate between
the nobles and plebeians, it obtained the return of
those who had been banished, on condition of the
equality of the two classes in the administration of
the government. Meanwhile Gutenberg, having
become absorbed in his inventive studies, did not return;
and his mother petitioned the Republic to give
him as a pension a portion of the revenue of his
confiscated property. Answer was given, that the
refusing to return to his own country, by the young
patrician, was a declaration of hostility; and he
must therefore be treated as one of its enemies.
So his mother continued to send him secret supplies
from her own resources.</p>

<p>But the faithful Lady Anna did not seek to free
herself from her plighted faith, because of the adversities
of her lover. If he shrank from receiving
her to the humble circumstances in which he had
been thrown, she was still true to her vows. And
as his humility and thoughtful scruples could not be
overcome in any other way, she vanquished them
by a legal summons; her father citing him before a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
magistrate of Strasbourg, to cause him to fulfill his
promise of marriage. This summons of the Lady
Anna to Gutenberg remains to-day as an authentic
memorial of his marriage. For the faltering artisan
yielded to “this generous violence of affection,”
and consummated his happiness by marrying the
fair plaintiff in the suit.</p>

<p>Gutenberg in Exile.&mdash;His Trade as Lapidary.&mdash;Curious Law.&mdash;Ancient
Cuts.&mdash;Picture of a Saint.&mdash;Legend.&mdash;The Bible
for the Poor.&mdash;A Secret discovered.&mdash;Gutenberg’s Experiment.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">After</span> his banishment, Gutenberg was not an
idler. During his exile, we are told that he
devoted time to travelling from city to city, studying
monuments, and visiting men celebrated in art,
science, or handicraft. For not only was he educated,
but he cultivated a literary taste, and had
chosen a trade, that of the lapidary, or polisher of
precious stones. Then, in Germany, the artisan,
or one trained to a trade, and the artist, held nearly
the same rank; since the trades, scarcely discovered,
were confounded with the arts. Indeed, when the
humbler professions brought forth their first <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chefs-d’œuvre</i>,
they were admired as prodigies, because
new. The mechanic arts held an honorable place,
only people of property being permitted to learn
them; this matter being regulated by the statutes.
Thus in England at that period it was decreed concerning
persons whose income was less than twenty
shillings by the year, “They shall be put to other
labors, upon pain of one year’s imprisonment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Hence artisans were a wealthy and influential
class in society, and, in some cases, with their daily
occupation cultivated a love of knowledge. And
Gutenberg, by learning the lapidary’s trade, did not
descend to the lowest social level, while at the same
time he acquired that mechanical skill which was
afterwards to turn to the benefit of the whole human
race.</p>

<p>He is pictured as occupying the front room of
his dwelling as a work-shop, where he plied his
trade during the day, and men of standing sought
the society of the cultivated artisan, “so high a popularity
did he enjoy in Strasbourg for his character
and scholarship.”</p>

<p>At this time, he seemed scarcely thirty, although
six years older; a health-tinted face, high fair forehead,
large blue expressive eyes, gave him a youthful
look. The precise turn of his chin was hidden
in a thick tawny beard. There was an air of grave
thoughtfulness about him, as if he was influenced
by some earnest purpose.</p>

<p>One evening, just after supper, the serving woman
Elsie having cleared the table and swept the
hearth, Gutenberg, always busy even in the cozy
comfort of his fireside, became absorbed in examining
a playing-card. The Lady Anna was seated beside
him, and after a little time looked up from her
work, and said in her own pleasant <span class="locked">way,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
“Prithee, John, what marvel dost thou find in
that card? One would think it the face of a saint,
so closely thou dost regard it.”</p>

<p>“Nay, little wife; but didst thou ever consider
in what way this is made?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that it was drawn in outline, and then
painted, like other pictures.”</p>

<p>“But there is a more excellent way,” said Gutenberg.
“These lines, I find, were first marked
on a wooden block, and then the wood was cut
away, so that they were left raised; this portion
was then smeared with ink and pressed on the paper.
And this, my Anna, is shorter than by drawing
and painting, because when once a block is
engraved, it can be used to impress any number
of cards.”</p>

<p>Playing-cards were at this period in common use.
Of their origin, there is some doubt. Some have
supposed they were invented to amuse Charles VI.,
King of France, as early as 1393. They are mentioned
at nearly the same date in the laws of both
England and Spain.</p>

<p>The first cards made were doubtless painted with
a stencil; that is, a piece of pasteboard or thin
metal plate perforated with holes in the shape of
the figures desired. The stencil being placed over
paper, the color is applied with a brush, leaving the
shape of the figures underneath. As they were so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
common and so cheap, it has been thought that the
outline must have been made by some rude form of
wood-engraving. There is proof that cards were
<em>printed</em> before the middle of the fifteenth century;
for there is a petition extant from the Venetian
painters to their magistracy, dated 1441, setting
forth that the art and mystery of card-making and
of printing figures, which was practiced in Venice,
had fallen into decay, because of the large quantity
of playing-cards and colored printed figures which
were brought into the city. What foreigners
brought them to Venice? Evidently the Germans;
for they were the chief card-makers of the
time. A wood-engraver is still called, in Germany,
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Formschneider</i>, meaning figure-cutter; and this
name is found in the town-books of Nuremburg as
early as 1441.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the early cards,&mdash;which were
very rude,&mdash;we have here the Knave of Bells.</p>

<p>Perhaps some may think Knave a good name
for the article, in view of the characters who sometimes
“play cards.” But this word had not always
the same meaning. Originally, it signified a
boy or young man, then a servant, and lastly a
rogue.</p>

<p>“An unsightly figure,” said Anna, as she examined
the one in her husband’s hand, “and not to be
compared to our St. Christopher,”&mdash;glancing at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
wall opposite, where hung a picture of the saint,&mdash;“which
was made with a pen!”</p>

<p>“Nay, it was made from an engraved block, like
the card,” said Gutenberg.</p>

<div id="ip_18" class="figcenter" style="width: 236px;">
  <img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="236" height="350" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">The Knave of Bells.</div></div>

<p>“Was our picture made in that manner?”
eagerly asked the wife. “What an excellent art,
since it keepeth before us the memory of the saints!
The good St. Christopher!” she exclaimed, and
with clasped hands for a moment gazed devoutly at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the picture,&mdash;a curious wood-cut, representing the
legendary saint in the act of carrying the infant
Jesus across the sea; beneath, was the date, 1423.
The art of engraving had doubtless existed long
before, but this is the only positive proof that wood-engraving
was used in devotional pictures at that
early period. Some years after, the art made an
onward and most important step,&mdash;an inscription
being added to this picture; and the famous block books,
complete with cuts and written explanations,
appeared.</p>

<p>The picture Anna so earnestly regarded, was one
of the later-date impressions, accompanied with a
Latin legend. It was of folio size, and colored, like
playing-cards. Beneath was the inscription, or <span class="locked">legend:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We almost worshipped that picture in my father’s
house,” said Anna; “but prithee tell me the
meaning of the inscription; there was none upon
ours.”</p>

<p>“It saith,” explained Gutenberg, “that one cannot
be overtaken by evil, or die, on the day that he
looks upon the face of this saint.”</p>

<p>“Since that is true, we do well to gaze upon the
picture early and late,” remarked the wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
“I revere the saint,” returned Gutenberg, smiling,
“but am free to confess that I do not see how
there can be any power to shield one from harm in
simply looking at his picture. The good saint himself
had not so easy a path to prosperity.”</p>

<p>“Pray tell me of him,” said she; “I do not remember
to have heard the story since, when a little
child, I sat upon my father’s knee.”</p>

<p>“I will even tell it to thee,” answered Gutenberg,
“as I heard it in my childhood.</p>

<p>“Offerus, as he was called, was a giant soldier;
a heathen, who lived in the land of Canaan. He
had a body twelve ells long. He did not like to
obey, but to command. He did not care what
harm he did to others, but lived a wild life, attacking
and plundering all who came in his way. He
only wished for one thing: to sell his services to
the mightiest. And he first engaged in the service
of the Emperor,&mdash;having heard in those days that
he was the head of Christendom,&mdash;yet was not
bound by any promise. Thereupon he went with
the Emperor through all the land, and the Emperor
was delighted with him. All the soldiers in the
combat were miserable, helpless creatures compared
with Offerus, with his Samson strength, giant chest,
and mighty fists. Once, at even-tide, they pitched
the tents near a forest, when the Emperor, in the
midst of his eating and drinking and the singing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
the minstrel, bade Offerus and his comrades beware
of the wicked fiend who was said often to haunt the
forest with great rage and fury, adding, ‘Let alone
the chase in this forest; for in filling thy larder,
thou mightest harm thy soul.’ Then Offerus said,
‘I will enter the service of this lord, who is
mightier than you,’ and thereupon took his departure,
and strode off cheerily into the thickest
depths of the forest. There on a coal black horse
he saw a pitch-black rider, who rode at him furiously,
and sought to bind him with solemn promises.
But Offerus said, ‘We shall see!’ However, one
day, as they went together through the kingdoms
of the world, along the high road three tall crosses
stood before them. The middle cross so appalled
Satan that he shrunk away, saying, ‘The Son of
Mary, the Lord Christ, now exercises great power.’
Said Offerus, ‘Now will I seek further for the
mightiest, whom only I will serve,’ and asking
every traveller he met where he dwelt. But alas!
few have Him in their hearts, and no one could tell,
until he was sent by a pious old hermit to a good
priest, who showed him plainly the path of faith,
and told him he must fast and pray, as John the
Baptist did of old in the wilderness. But that advice
was not to the giant’s liking; wherefore the
prior said, ‘Give yourself up heartily to achieve
some good work. See, there flows a mighty river,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
which hinders pilgrims on their way to Rome; it
has neither ford nor bridge: carry the faithful over
on thy back.’ ‘Ah, I have strength for that!’
said Offerus. ‘If I can please the Saviour in that
way, willingly will I carry the travellers to and fro.’
And thereupon he built a hut of reeds, and dwelt
among the water-rats and beavers on the river’s
brink, carrying pilgrims over the river cheerfully,
like a camel or an elephant. But if any one offered
him ferry-money, he said, ‘I labor for eternal life!’
And when now, after many years, Offerus’s hair
had grown white, one stormy night a plaintive little
voice called to him, ‘Dear, good, tall Offerus, carry
me across.’ Offerus was tired and sleepy; but he
thought faithfully of Jesus Christ, and with weary
arms seizing the pine-trunk which was his staff
when the floods swelled high, he waded through
the water, but saw no pilgrim there; so he thought,
‘I was dreaming,’ and went back and lay down to
sleep. Again came the little voice, plaintive and
touching, ‘Offerus, good, dear, great, tall Offerus,
carry me across.’ Patiently the old giant crossed
the river again; but neither man nor mouse was to
be seen; and he went back again, and fell asleep,
when once more came the little voice, clear, and
plaintive, and imploring, “Good, dear, giant Offerus,
carry me across.” The third time he seized
his pine-stem, and went through the cold river.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
This time he found a tender, fair little boy, with
golden hair. In his left hand was the standard of
the Lamb; in his right, the globe. He looked at
the giant with eyes full of love and trust, and Offerus
lifted him up with two fingers; but when he
entered the river, the little child weighed on him
like a ton. Heavier and heavier grew the weight,
until the water almost reached his chin; great drops
of sweat stood on his brow, and he had nearly sunk
in the stream with the little one. However, he struggled
through, and, tottering to the other side, set
the child gently down on the bank, and said, ‘My
little Lord, prithee, come not this way again, for
scarcely have I escaped this time with life.’ But
the fair child baptized Offerus on the spot, and said
to him, ‘Know, all thy sins are forgiven; and, although
thy limbs tottered, fear not, nor marvel, but
rejoice; thou hast carried the Saviour of the world!
For a token, plant thy pine-trunk, so long dead and
leafless, in the earth; to-morrow it shall shoot out
green twigs. And henceforth thou shalt not be
called Offerus, but Christopher.’ Then Christopher
folded his arms, and prayed, and said, ‘I feel
my end draws nigh. My limbs tremble; my
strength fails; and God has forgiven me all my
sins.’ Thereupon the child vanished in light; and
Christopher set his staff in the earth. And so, on
the morrow, it shot out green leaves and red blossoms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
like an almond. And three days afterwards
the angels carried Christopher to Paradise.”</p>

<p>Anna’s eyes swam in tears as Gutenberg finished
his graphic and touching rehearsal, and she said,
“A most hopeful history. May you, my husband,
worthily achieve some good work, like St. Christopher!”</p>

<p>“Aye, dear; and, God helping me I will do
something: the world is full of useful labor, which
calleth for willing hearts and hands. And the
Lord Christ meeteth with his blessing the patient
laborers who faint not.”</p>

<p>“I can never think,” said the wife, “of equaling
St. Christopher or thee in good works, since I am
neither strong nor wise; but I will even do what I
can, and help thee bear thy burdens. But it may
be the gentle Christ will freely <em>give</em> me eternal life,
since I have no means to purchase it.”</p>

<p>“Aye, Anna, that would be so like Him: and
to me also, for I am no saint, and dare not hope to
be.”</p>

<p>“But I value the picture the more since your
recital,” said Anna. “Even if it cannot, as you
think, preserve us from evil, it can incite us to persevere
in doing well.”</p>

<p>“Aye, dear,” rejoined Gutenberg, “and devotional
pictures like this are much to be prized; they in
some sort fill the place of books, which are so rare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
and costly. But valuable as this picture is, I found
it surpassed in the Cathedral. Dost remember I
carried thither the jewels which the Abbot employed
me to polish? He took me into the library, and
showed me books of engraved pictures, each far
more excellent than our ‘St. Christopher.’ These
books were the ‘Ars Memorandi,’ ‘Ars Moriendi,’
and ‘Biblia Pauperum,’ which last consists of forty
pictures, with written explanations.”</p>

<p>“Truly a marvel,&mdash;a book of pictures! And
what do they signify?”</p>

<p>“The ‘Biblia Pauperum,’ or ‘Bible for the Poor,’
is a history or series of sketches from the Old and
New Testaments; it is sometimes so called instead
of the name I first mentioned.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I remember to have heard of it, but would
fain learn more about it.”</p>

<p>“Its forty pictures were made by impressing paper
with engraved blocks, as in the ‘St. Christopher.’
The color is brown, the pictures are placed
opposite each other, and the blank backs are pasted
together into one strong leaf.”</p>

<p>“Pray, how large are the pictures?” and her interest
growing with her husband’s recital, she quite
forgot the work on which she was engaged, as he
went on to <span class="locked">say,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“They are each ten inches high and seven or
eight inches wide, and consist of three pictures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
which are separated by lines; and, moreover, there
are four half-length figures of prophets, two above
and two below the larger pictures. Latin inscriptions
are on each side of the upper figures, also
verses in rhyme on each side of the lower, and
other sentences on labels at the bottom of the
whole.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful truly! and what more?”</p>

<p>“The middle pictures are from the New Testament,
the others from the Old; and the latter in
some way allude to or explain the former.”</p>

<p>“But what interests me most in this book,” added
Gutenberg, “is the fact that it is printed from
blocks, like the ‘St. Christopher.’”</p>

<p>“Dost thou truly think so? Art thou well
advised that it is not the handicraft of a skillful
scribe?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly I am; it was not made with a pen,
but with the engraved blocks, which are to be
chosen rather than the slower mode of copying,
since being once for all engraved, a number of
books can be imprinted as easily as one.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” returned Anna, “and they will be
cheaper than the works written out by the scribes,
and still be so dear that whoever maketh them must
become enriched by their sale. If thou art taken
with this tide, it will lead thee on to fortune. Thou
art ingenious; and canst thou not make a ‘Biblia
Pauperum?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
“A ‘Biblia Pauperum!’ Little wife, thou must
be dreaming.” And Gutenberg saw that she had
penetrated his secret.</p>

<p>“But couldst thou not?” she persisted archly;
“thou art so wise at devising things difficult to be
accomplished.”</p>

<p>Gutenberg laughed, saying, “I will even bethink
me of it when nothing of more service can be
done.”</p>

<p>But although the suggestion of Anna had been
treated as a new and impracticable idea, it was one,
as she had divined, that Gutenberg was revolving;
and seizing the first leisure hour, he commenced
engraving a block, choosing for his subject
as simplest and nearest at hand, one of the images
of the playing cards.</p>

<p>Anna’s estimate of Gutenberg was just. He had
a passion for mechanical studies; and history tells
us that “he invented many wonderful arts,” some
of which were connected with his occupation. Not
content with following the beaten track, his mind
was fertile in expedients for saving labor and perfecting
his work. He devised ways to improve the
process of polishing stones and mirrors; and these
new methods were ranked by the observing among
his “arts.” These “arts” were stepping-stones to
something better and higher&mdash;to the crowning discovery
of his life. The great art could only be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
reached by patiently ascending to it through many
lower steps of toil and invention. “It seems,” says
one, “that every advancement of humanity is purchased
with tears, and that suffering is the fatal law
of all great beginnings.”</p>

<p>But how eventful the path he trod, we shall see
as we progress.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Leaving</span> Gutenberg occupied with his experiment,
let us glance briefly at the books of
that day, and the modes in which they were made
and given to the world.</p>

<p>The most ancient materials used for recording
events were bricks, tiles, shells, and tables of stone.
The modes of writing on these different substances
were various. The tiles and brick were impressed
with a stamp when in a soft state; the shells and
tablets of stone were etched or graven, the figures
or characters being cut in their surface, and in some
cases also stained with various colors. It was by
the ancient art of stamping that the walls, palaces,
and towers of Babylon were covered with hieroglyphics,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
which have but recently been brought to
light from under the immense mounds of Mesopotamia
by Layard and other explorers.</p>

<div id="ip_30" class="figcenter" style="width: 234px;">
  <img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="234" height="249" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Babylonian Brick.</div></div>

<p>The patriarch Job, who is supposed to have lived
about 2,300 years after the creation, exclaimed, “O
that my words were now written! O that they
were printed in a book! that they were graven
with an iron pen, and hid in the rock forever!”
Stung with the unjust accusation of his friends, he
desires to record his words that the generations following
might see the justice of his cause. The
English translation has given the allusion to printing
to the text, the original word signifying rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
to ingrave on a plate, which was doubtless the only
printing known to Job.</p>

<p>Montfauçon purchased at Rome in 1699 an ancient
book entirely composed of lead. It was about
four inches long and three inches wide; and not only
were the two pieces that formed the cover, and the
leaves, six in number, of lead, but also the stick inserted
through the rings to hold the leaves together,
as well as the hinges and nails. It contained figures
of Egyptian idols, and unintelligible writing.</p>

<p>China, our ancestor in invention, from remote ages
had a kind of stereotyping or printing. It was not,
however, as some have supposed, like our printing,
phonetic, or the expression of sound, but, like the
Egyptian, hieroglyphical; being purely of an artificial
structure, denoting every idea by its appropriate
sign without any relation to the utterance, and
speaking to the eye like the numerical ciphers of
the Europeans, which every one understands and
utters in his own way. And like most other nations
of antiquity, the Chinese were content to remain
without alphabetical writing. It is, however,
due to the Chinese to add, that they led the way in
making good printing-paper. When they invented
making it, does not appear, some affirming that
they had the use of it from time immemorial; others
that they first discovered it in the second century
of the Christian era.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Brass, as more durable, was used for inscriptions
designed to last the longest, such as treaties, laws,
and alliances. Seals, also, were used by the ancients
for impressing soft substances. In the British
Museum there is a stamp of metal with raised
letters. On the back of it is a ring, enabling the
owner to wear it as a signet; his name, Caius Julius
Cæcilius Hermias, being engraved in reversed
letters upon it.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="bbox">
CICAECILI<br />
HERMIAE.SN.
</div></div>

<p>Expanded according to the modern practice, the
signet <span class="locked">reads:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center smaller" xml:lang="la" lang="la">
C. I. CÆCILII HERMIÆ SIGNUM.<br />
<i>Caii Julii Cæcilii Hermiæ Signum.</i>
</p>

<p>This seal of Hermias was intended for stamping
parchment with ink, as is shown by the fact that the
roughness of the surface below the letters unfits it
for stamping any soft substance into which it would
sink, as into wax. If rubbed with printer’s ink and
pressed upon paper, it prints very well. Thus the
seed of this noble art was among the Romans.
With a block of wood covered with raised letters,
they might have printed a page, as well as a single
name. But they were suffered to grope their way
from age to age blindfolded to the art of which
they had the clew. They almost grasped the great
discovery, unconscious of the prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Quintilian, speaking of the education of youth,
says, “When the boy has begun to trace the forms
of the letters, it will be useful for him to have the
letters of the tablet engraved, that through them, as
through furrows, he may draw his style. For thus
he will neither make mistakes, being prevented by
the edges on both sides, nor will he be able to go
beyond the proper bound; and by tracing quickly
and frequently certain forms, he will strengthen his
joints, and will not need the assistance of some one
to put his hand above his own, and guide it.” Here
we find that the old Romans knew something of the
art of stenciling.</p>

<p>The Emperor Justin, who lived in the sixth century,
could not write, and, to avoid the shame of
making only a mark for his name, caused holes to
be bored through a tablet in the shape of the first
four letters of his name. Through these holes he
traced the letters in red ink. Theodoric, King of
the Ostrogoths, it is said, wrote his name through
a gold plate, in the same manner.</p>

<p>Tablets, or little tables of wood, as well as of
metal, came at length to take the place of stone
tables. The thin wooden tables were sometimes
covered with wax, which was written upon with a
style, or ivory pencil. These were so much like
tracing in the sand, as soon to be laid aside, and
the smooth, inner bark of trees, called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">liber</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Latin, was used instead; also the leaves of the
palm-tree, cloths of cotton and linen, the intestines
and skins of animals, and the backs of tortoises.
We derive our name <em>book</em> from the Danish <i xml:lang="da" lang="da">bog</i>, the
beech-tree, since that was used to engrave on in
Denmark, because of its abundance.</p>

<p>The Egyptians very early employed a broad-leafed
rush growing on the banks of the Nile, as a
material upon which to write. This was the <em>papyrus</em>,
a word which has given its name to our modern
paper. Large bundles of papyrus manuscripts, covered
with hieroglyphics, have been found in the ancient
tombs and temples of that country, some of
which are capable of being deciphered at the present
day.</p>

<p>Parchment, which is the prepared skins of animals,
came into use <span class="smcap">B.&nbsp;C.</span> 250. It was so called
from Pergamus (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">membrana pergamea</i>), whose king,
Eumenes, seeking to collect a library which should
vie with that of Alexandria, and being debarred a
supply of papyrus by the jealousy of the Ptolemies,
had recourse to this substitute. After the eighth
century, parchment generally took the place of
papyrus.</p>

<p>Ancient books were not commonly disposed in a
square form, as with us, but were <em>rolled</em> up. Hence
the word <em>volume</em>, signifying a roll.</p>

<p>Paper from cotton and linen rags began, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
thought, to be made as early as the ninth century.
For several centuries, however, the manufacture
was so scanty as to increase very little the facilities
for copying. Gradually, it became more plentiful,
and writing material of small cost laid the foundation
for that cheap and expeditious mode of copying
which we call printing.</p>

<p>In the age when parchment was used, it was often
difficult to be obtained; and it became common to
erase the original writing from a manuscript and
trace another upon it. A parchment thus used
was called <em>palimpsest</em>, which means “twice prepared
for writing.” Thus, many valuable works were
destroyed to make way for newer, and, in some
cases, less important ones. Happily we live in a
time when we have no occasion to destroy one
library to produce another.</p>

<p>It seems strange, too, that a transcriber familiar
with the labor of copying would not be deterred by
his love of learning from putting even one book out
of existence. But necessity knew no law; and the
writer, deeming his own work to possess greater
utility, sacrificed another to make room for it,&mdash;to
such straits were the scribes sometimes brought for
the lack of writing material. Struggling to express
thought, there was no room to put it down. Written
language, scarcely second to spoken language, had
almost perished; and had the art of printing been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
invented before paper was known, it would have
been comparatively useless.</p>

<p>The writing and rewriting on parchment, as it
was often done two or three times, has recently led
learned men to make these ancient parchments a
study; and they have thus deciphered or read the
last writing, then, effacing that, have deciphered
the second, and, effacing that, have read the first,&mdash;often
the most valuable,&mdash;and in this way have
brought to light lost works, and found out many
important facts of history.</p>

<p>The books of those early days were written out
by hand, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">manuscripta</i>; and the profession of the
copyist was one of the most numerous, honorable,
and lucrative. Some booksellers employed great
numbers of copyists, paying them salaries, and made
their own livelihood on the profits of selling the
works thus copied. There were in Rome, and in
some of the great cities of Greece and of Asia,
particular places where such works were sold. The
rich also sometimes had slaves, prized more highly
and treated more familiarly than other slaves, who
were devoted by them to copying the works of
antiquity and of their time, for their libraries.
Government, too, employed a great many copyists
for its edicts, and orators employed them in transcribing
their discourses. Later, the eunuchs copied
at Byzantium the chief works of Greek, Latin, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Hebrew antiquity. Finally, there were the monks,
who, in the retirement of the monasteries, gave their
time very much to the multiplication of books by
the slow process of writing.</p>

<p>In every great religious house, or abbey, there
was an apartment called the scriptorium, or writing-room,
where boys and young men were employed
from morning till night in copying the singing-books
of the choir, and the less valuable books of the
library. Only a few of the monks copied in this
large apartment, enough to give directions, and
keep order among the boys and novices. Most of
the “Holy Fathers,” as they chose to be styled,
spent their time in the cells, transcribing Bibles and
other valuable works.</p>

<div id="ip_37" class="figleft" style="width: 151px;">
  <img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="151" height="198" alt="" /></div>

<p>A monk copying. He has
a cowl on his head, and wears
the priest’s long gown with
flowing sleeves. His waist
is girt with a belt; and he
sits bolt upright, or slightly
leans forward in the most
perpendicular of arm-chairs,
which seems to be joined to
the desk of his cell. How
curiously he holds his quill and pointed ferule! His
prior is cautious and methodical; for he has chained
the manuscript from which the monk is copying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the wall, as if experience had taught him that he
cannot overmuch trust the brothers.</p>

<p>An author of those times would make a similar
appearance, save that there would be no book before
him, unless for reference.</p>

<p>Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, in his “Philobiblion,”
a treatise on the love of books, written
by him in Latin in 1344, gives a good picture of the
transcriber, or copyist of the monastery. He says:
“As it is necessary for a State to provide military
arms, and prepare plentiful stores of provisions for
soldiers who are about to fight, so it is evidently
worth the labor of the Church to fortify itself against
the attacks of pagans and heretics with a multitude
of sound books. But, because everything that is
of use to mortals decays through lapse of time, it
is necessary for volumes corroded by age to be restored
by new successors, that books may not cease
to exist. Hence it is that Ecclesiastes truly says,
in the 12th chapter, ‘There is no end of making
many books.’ For, as the bodies of books decay,
so a remedy is found out by the prudence of clerks,
by which a holy book paying the debt of nature
[<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, dying] may have one succeed it, and a seed
may be raised up like to the most holy deceased, and
that saying of Ecclesiastes, chapter thirtieth, be
verified: ‘The father is dead, and as it were not
dead, for he hath left behind him a son like unto
himself.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Then he goes on to upbraid the priests for soiling
books, giving us rather an unfavorable impression
concerning the habits of the monks. One would
suppose that they could command the leisure to keep
clean. The Bishop just quoted deplores “the unwashed
hands, the dirty nails, the greasy elbows
leaning upon the volume, the munching of fruit and
cheese over the open leaves, which were the marks
of careless and idle readers,” and suggestive also,
some would say, of lack of culture and refinement,
and even that their religion was of a low type; else
would it not, at least, have produced the virtue
which is next to godliness?</p>

<p>Then follow sound and sensible directions how to
use books. “Let there be a mature decorum in
opening and closing of volumes, that they may
neither be unclasped with precipitous haste, nor
thrown aside after use without being duly closed.”</p>

<p>Says an English writer: “When a volume was
at last produced in fair parchment, or vellum, after
the arduous labor of years, it was covered with immensely
thick lids of wood and leather, studded
with large nails, and curiously clasped, and was
studiously preserved from the common gaze on the
shelves of the monastic library.</p>

<p>“The splendid volumes thus made, bore evidence,
however, not only of persevering industry, but of
great ingenuity; the letters at the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
each chapter or section being adorned with curious
devices. Frequently, too, a painting called an illumination
was introduced radiant with gold, crimson,
and azure. But no vulgar or unpriestly eyes looked
on their contents, unless, indeed, we except kings
and princes; they were only unclasped on days of
solemnity, by the abbot or the prior, and then restored,
like the jewels of the priesthood, to their
dusty cases.”</p>

<p>Montgomery says, “The readers of those days
were rather gluttons than epicures in their taste for
literature,” canonizing all books because they were
books, as children eulogize their toys without noticing
the quality. “To say all that could be said
on any theme, whether in verse or prose, was the
fashion of the times; and as few read but those who
were devoted to reading by an irresistible passion
or professional necessity, and few wrote but those
who were equally impelled by an inveterate instinct,
great books were the natural produce of the latter,
who knew not how to make little ones; and great
books only could appease the voracity of the former.
Great books, therefore, were both the fruits and the
proofs of the ignorance of the age. They were
mostly composed in the gloom and torpor of the
cloister, and it almost required a human life to read
the works of an author of this description, because
it was nearly as easy to compound as to digest such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
crudities.” These labors of the learned could not
of course interest the common people, as they could
neither understand nor buy them. These were
books without meaning,&mdash;with so little logic
and connection that the more one read, the deeper he
got into the maze or tangled mass of words. “And
the lucubrations through a thousand years, of many
a noble, many a lovely mind, which only wanted
better direction how to unfold its energies or display
its graces to benefit or delight mankind, were
but passing meteors, that made visible the darkness
out of which they rose, and into which they sank
again to be hid forever.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we owe it to the monks to say that
there were many good and learned men among
them, and for much that is valuable in our libraries
we can not thank them enough. We can never consult
a concordance of the Bible without calling to
mind that they first conceived the idea of such a
work, and numbers of them, jointly laboring long
and incessantly, nobly laid its foundations, on which
others who came after raised the structure and
reaped the glory.</p>

<p>It will be readily inferred from what has been
said that books in those times were scarce and
costly. Only the rich could afford to have them,
and they had but very few. The monasteries and
universities had libraries, and occasionally one was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
found in the castles of the nobility. The Cathedral
of Nôtre Dame, in Strasbourg, was famed for its
splendid collection of five hundred volumes. The
Countess of Anjou bought a book of Homilies, paying
for it two hundred sheep, five quarters of wheat,
and the same quantity of rye and millet. Henry
V., King of England, borrowed a book from the
Countess of Westmoreland; and not having returned
it at his death, the Countess petitioned the
Privy Council that it might be restored to her by
an order under the privy seal, which was done with
all formality.</p>

<p>Richard de Bury, whom we have already mentioned,
had gathered in his life-time, by copying with
his own hand and by purchase, a valuable library.
In his will he bestowed a portion of it upon “a
company of scholars residing in a hall at Oxford,”
and one of his chapters is headed “A Provident
Arrangement by which Books may be lent to
Strangers,” meaning, by strangers, students of Oxford
not belonging to that hall.</p>

<p>This library, from which a book could not be
borrowed without giving ample security, was finally
given to Durham, now Trinity College, and contained
more books than all the bishops of England
had then in their possession. For many years after
they were received they were kept in chests, under
the custody of several scholars chosen for that purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
It was not till the reign of Henry IV. that a
library was built in that college; and then the books
were taken out of the old sepulchral chests, and
“were put into pews or studies and chained to
them.” In 1300, the library of Oxford consisted of
a few tracts kept in a chest.</p>

<div id="ip_43" class="figcenter" style="width: 122px;">
  <img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="122" height="114" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Chained Bible.</div></div>

<p>The statutes of St. Mary’s College, Oxford, in the
reign of Henry VI., furnish striking proof of the
obstacles to study caused by a scarcity of books.
“Let no scholar occupy a book in the library above
one hour, or two hours at most, so that others shall
be hindered from the use of the same.” This reveals
quite a famine of books, but not so great as
at a still earlier period of the Church, when one
book was given out by the librarian to each of a
religious fraternity at the beginning of Lent, to be
read diligently during the year, and to be returned
the following Lent.</p>

<p>The old way of shutting up books in chests shows
that they could not be often changed, for whenever
one was wanted the whole pile must be disturbed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
The next plan was to allow the books the privilege
of light and air, but to chain them to desks and in
cages, as if their keepers looked upon them literally
as riches with wings ready to fly away.</p>

<p>The following passage, malediction of some grim
friar perhaps, was often written on the first leaf of a
book: “Cursed be he who shall steal or tear out
the leaves, or in any way injure this book.”</p>

<p>A milder and more modern couplet, <span class="locked">is&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Steal not this book for fear of shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here you see the owner’s name.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thus various were the devices from time to time
to secure the possession of treasures more precious
than gold.</p>

<p>How different the state of things at this day!
Instead of being rare and expensive luxuries, books
are abundant both in the homes of the rich and the
poor.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">One</span> day, a few weeks after the events in our
second chapter, Gutenberg surprised his wife
as she sat sewing by the window, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Behold some of my handicraft!” showing her
a number of cards.</p>

<p>“Ah, and so you did not give up the project?
and you have succeeded so well! One could not
distinguish between these and the old ones, save
that these are newer and fresher.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, this is but a step; it availeth me
little till I can frame letters, and impress them on
vellum in like manner. It remains that I try thy
name, my Anna. I cannot fail to engrave that name
on wood, which hath been so long traced on my
heart!” And to his loving glance there beamed
a happy light in her eyes, and her cheeks were
aglow, as he betook him to writing her name on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
small wooden tablet. Cutting away the wood, except
the writing lines, he left the letters raised, or
in relief, and thus formed a stamp of his wife’s
name. Moistening it with ink, he placed a piece
of paper over it, and, gently pressing it upon the
letters, beheld, on lifting it, the word imprinted
upon the paper.</p>

<div id="ip_46" class="figcenter" style="width: 138px;">
  <img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="138" height="45" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="bold">Anna</span></div></div>

<p>We of this age of books and papers cannot enter
into his emotions. But Anna could, and so the
good man did not miss our sympathy.</p>

<p>“Famously done!” she exclaimed; “it is the
likeness of writing.”</p>

<p>Does this seem to us a curious commendation of
printing, that it resembled writing? But the manuscript
letter was the only one known as yet, and it
was natural to judge the result of the new experiment
by its agreement with that letter.</p>

<p>“Aye, I think myself it is not a failure,” said Gutenberg;
“and I fancy it would not be difficult for
me to produce a copy of that picture of ‘St. Christopher,’
I mean by suitable patience and perseverance.”</p>

<p>“But was not that done with a pen?”</p>

<p>“Nay: it appears so, but on examination I find
that it was made with an engraved block;” and
taking the rude print from the wall, he showed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the back of it the marks of the stylus, or burnisher
by which it was rubbed upon the letters. “Rest assured
from this that they were never produced by
a pen, as in common writing.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned the good wife, “it would truly
be a pious act to multiply the picture of ‘St. Christopher,’
since a blessing will follow him who looketh
upon it. I would fain have one in our sleeping-room,
that my eyes may light upon it when I awake.”</p>

<p>Poor Anna! she had already forgotten Gutenberg’s
sensible remark on a former occasion. Educated
to attach a superstitious value to sacred pictures,
she still relied on them. This perverted
trust, however, shows that she felt her need of
the protection and favor of a higher than human
power.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the approbation of his wife, and
nerved by that passion which urges the inventor
onward in the pathway of discovery, Gutenberg undertook
the task with alacrity. First he met the
difficulty of finding wood suitable for engraving.
Some kinds were too soft and porous, others liable
to split. After many trials, he selected the wood of
the apple-tree. This has a fine grain, is dense and
compact, and sufficiently firm to bear the process
of engraving. In modern times box-wood is almost
exclusively used in this art, as superior to all other
species in the qualities required. It is sawed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
blocks crosswise of the grain, and these polished
and whitened, present a surface almost as smooth
as ivory, and capable of receiving the finest touches
of the pencil and the graving tool.</p>

<p>Another difficulty in his course was the want of
tools; his unfailing genius came to the rescue, and
tool after tool was contrived, until his tool-box
showed an array of knives, saws, chisels, and gravers
of various patterns, each one in its turn having
been duly admired by the pair of bright eyes that
followed his progress.</p>

<p>At first Gutenberg drew the portrait of the saint
and the inscriptions accompanying it on the same
block; but in later experiments he hit upon the
idea of having them on separate pieces, the different
blocks being nicely fitted together in printing.
This was an onward step, which he viewed with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“These movable blocks will be of service,” said
he to Anna; “for I can complete the picture as well
as the letters better in this way, and, when desirable,
can embellish the writing with ink of another
color.”</p>

<p>At length, when the “St. Christopher” appeared,
printed from the improved block, Anna exclaimed
that it was far better than the old one.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Gutenberg, “but I perceive that
it is not perfect. No picture can be properly executed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
without thicker ink. This flows too readily,
and with all my care I can scarcely avoid blotting.”</p>

<p>It required many experiments and much patience
to surmount this difficulty of the ink. He found
finally that a preparation of oil would best serve his
purpose. The color might be varied according to
the ingredients used. In the earliest works which
have come down to us, it is of a darkish brown,
and appears to have been made of umber. This
was chosen probably in imitation of the old drawings
which served as copies. A mixture of lamp-black
with oil gives a black ink; and this is substantially
the composition of printer’s ink at the present
day.</p>

<p>As Gutenberg experimented, Anna watched his
progress with excited interest. When he had succeeded
in preparing an ink of suitable quality, she
saw that he needed some means of spreading it
evenly upon the block.</p>

<p>“Now indeed thou canst aid me,” said he; “stuff
and sew this piece of sheep-skin, while I prepare
the paper for the impressions.” The nimbly flying
fingers soon completed the task; and when Gutenberg
had added a handle to the ball, the first printer’s
dabber was ready. “One more servant of my
art,” Gutenberg pleasantly said as he dipped it in
the ink which he had ground upon a slab, and applied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
it to a block. He then laid the paper upon
it, and, with the polished handle of one of his graving
tools, carefully smoothed and pressed it upon
the raised portions of the block,&mdash;both picture and
its letters. He then cautiously removed it, and
both viewed the result with joyful emotions.</p>

<p>“The new ink works marvelously!” said the inventor.</p>

<p>“And this print even surpasses your first attempt!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I value it the more for the labor and
contrivance it has cost me.”</p>

<p>“Now I shall want a ‘St. Christopher’ in every
room,” said Anna; “it will be like having more
good people in the house, and our lives will be inspired
by the memory of what they have done.”</p>

<p>“But what am I to do?” rejoined Gutenberg.
“I cannot afford the time and money to occupy
myself in making pictures, unless it can also be
turned to some pecuniary advantage.”</p>

<p>“And is there no way of acquiring money from
them?”</p>

<p>“Not at present. I have, however, made an improvement
on the pictures; they will grace our
humble home, and it may be that I can make them
useful to others.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for whoever seeth them will want one.”</p>

<p>“And be willing to pay for it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
“Aye, why not?”</p>

<p>“We shall see. Thou hast confidence in my
experiments.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed have I; since I perceive that thou
hast the power of devising wonderful arts!”</p>

<p>Thus cheerily did the lapidary’s wife encourage
him, admiring his work, suggesting the bright
side of affairs, then tripping out into the yard to
console the pigeons with seeds, to water her flowers,
and train the wild-growing climbers within bounds,
her heart the meanwhile full of her husband’s enterprise;
and she murmured to <span class="locked">herself,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“John will succeed, and we shall be delivered
from our trouble.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pecuniary Troubles.&mdash;An Expedient.&mdash;Disappointment.&mdash;The
Jewels.&mdash;A Sale.&mdash;Apprentices.&mdash;Visit to the Cathedral.&mdash;A
New Enterprise.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Gutenberg</span>’s gratifying success was not devoid
of trial, as has been hinted. In his hasty
flight from Mentz, he had little money with him,
and years of embarrassment followed, despite his
diligence in business and economy. His mother’s
remittances had been carefully husbanded;
but since engaging in block-printing, this store had wasted
away.</p>

<p>How could he retrieve his losses, and gain means
to bring out other discoveries? He revolved the
matter while Anna slept, and, rising with early
dawn, took impressions of the “St. Christopher.”
At breakfast he told his wife of his purpose to sell
them to his neighbors. She warmly approved, and
offered to arrange them in the shop, greatly to the
relief of Gutenberg, who answered with emotion,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
“So thoughtful of thee, my Anna; and our necessity
urgeth speedy sales.”</p>

<p>“Aye, they shall beautify the shop,” said the little
lady as she arranged the cuts, placing one here,
another there, and viewing the effect of the light,
and hied her to the adjoining room, just when Mrs.
Anna Schultheiss stepped into the shop on her way
home from market. Her dowry jewels were being
reset, and she was anxious to get them.</p>

<p>“My jewels not done yet!” she exclaimed,
“All, indeed, master, and how can I go to the marriage-feast,
wanting them?”</p>

<p>“Be content, mistress,” replied Gutenberg;
“thou shall have them at sunset.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, good master; but what pictures are
these?” glancing around the room as she spoke.
As he passed one for her inspection, she cried:
“Mirabile! the good saint! See him bearing the
infant Jesus over the water. How could the child
have forded the stream without him? Wrap the picture
nicely, and I will take it home with me. My
husband is a formschneider, and thou mayst need his
aid.” Gutenberg crimsoned, but gave her the cut on
her own terms, and she bore it away with delight.</p>

<p>When next a neighbor called, and after admiring
the prints, purchased one, the inventor breathed
more freely; and the lively sound of his graving
tools soon indicated how greatly encouragement
lightened his toil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Others, however, calling to purchase gems, chose
the pictures. At the evening meal Anna was radiant,
and congratulated her husband that the pictures
found a ready sale.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I have lost money to-day,” replied
he, a little depressed.</p>

<p>“Ah! and how did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Those who purchased prints had purposed to
buy gems, and a fair estimation makes me the loser.
The pictures draw attention from my jewels and
mirrors, and do not return an equivalent. I fear
the two pursuits will so conflict as to prevent success
with either!”</p>

<p>Anna was illy prepared for this intelligence, and
urged, “But thou wilt do better when used to both
labors. Moreover, I can aid thee. Did I not arrange
the cuts? And when the wood-carrier admired
my print, did I not sell him one, and allow
him to bring wood in payment?”</p>

<p>“Thou hast well earned a benediction,” returned
the husband, smiling.</p>

<p>“When dost thou go to Nôtre Dame Cathedral?”
asked Anna.</p>

<p>“When I shall have finished the Father’s jewels.
I must confess to thee, dear, as before, that in engraving
blocks I have lost ground in my trade.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” replied Anna, bent on dispelling
his despondency, “it is a favorable omen that thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
handicraft of pictures is of the saint that shieldeth
from evil.”</p>

<p>By dint of close application, Gutenberg, having
completed the Superior’s jewels by noon of the
next day, returned to his engraved blocks, and before
evening of the second day had given the finishing
touch to several prints. Laden with jewels and
pictures, he left the house, Anna wishing him Godspeed,
and watching him till the mass of vines,
shrubbery, and apple-trees hid him from sight.
The cloistered Cathedral was not far distant, yet
the winding way which led there was quickly lost
in the luxuriant foliage.</p>

<p>On his arrival he was ushered into the library,
which might be termed a scriptorium, or monks’
writing-room, so many copyists there plied the pen.
Having delivered the jewels, he showed his pictures.</p>

<p>“Whose handicraft may this be?” quoth a gray-headed
friar.</p>

<p>“The name of the artisan doth not appear,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“Where didst thou obtain them?” asked
another.</p>

<p>“Suffer me to keep a little secret,” replied Gutenberg,
“which would not benefit thee if told.”</p>

<p>“I will purchase the entire lot,” said the Abbot,
after examining them. “They will grace the walls
of the library, and tend to preserve us from evil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Anna came running to meet Gutenberg as he returned,
and was well pleased to learn of the sale.</p>

<p>“And now,” said she, “thou art in a fair way
to get rich!” But Gutenberg said, <span class="locked">gravely,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We must not forget that the steady gains of a
regular business are more to be relied on than occasional
successes in other pursuits.” Yet Gutenberg
was himself loath to take this view, and turned
reluctantly to his trade.</p>

<p>Not long after, he was surprised one morning by
the entrance of Andrew Dritzhn, an intelligent citizen
of Strasbourg, stout and hale-looking, and about
thirty-five years of age. Taking a seat, he wound
through a long talk, and at last made known his errand,
which was to ask that Gutenberg would allow
him to come and learn his trade. The latter loved
the quiet of his own thoughts too well to choose the
presence of a workman in his shop.</p>

<p>But when he considered that if he once had a
good artisan in his employ, the jewel and mirror
business could go on, and himself have more time
for his printing researches, he decided to engage
Dritzhn. But no sooner was Dritzhn in favor with
his new employer than he introduced his friends
Hielman, whose brother was the first paper-maker
in Strasbourg, and Riffe, who craved a like favor
of being admitted to learn Gutenberg’s trade. The
shop now presented a busy scene with three apprentices,&mdash;Dritzhn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
careful, plodding, ingenious,
and eager to learn; Riffe, mostly engaged on mirrors,
complacently catching glimpses of his own
round visage as his work waxed bright; and Hielman,
polishing jewels and making himself generally
useful. But what with the din of the wheel, saw,
chisel, and polisher, the inventor had little time for
thought. It was, “How shall I do this, Master Gutenberg?”
“What next, master?” from morning
till night; and he could not command time to pursue
his engraved blocks, as he had hoped. Yet it
was necessary, for the purpose of disguising from
his associates for a longer time the real object of his
secret enterprise, to devote himself with them to
many curious and secondary industries. There
was “the cutting and fashioning of precious stones;
the polishing of Venetian glass to make mirrors;
cutting the mirrors into facettes or diamonds; the
encasing them in copper frames, which he enriched
with figures of wood representing personages of
fable and of the Bible.” These mirrors were sold
at the fair of Aix-la-Chapelle, and helped the funds
of the association, as well as Gutenberg in the secret
expenses destined to accomplish and perfect his
invention. To secure the needed seclusion, he fitted
up a room, and spent his evenings on the hidden
art in the presence of Anna, after the workmen had
left the front shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
For the purpose of selling “St. Christophers,”
he again visited Nôtre Dame; and on his return,
Anna’s glance at his face assured her that he
brought good news.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he, “but it is not because I have returned
with much money, although I may have
done as well.” And undoing a wrapper he produced
the “Historia Sancti Johannis Evangelistæ,”
or “History of St. John the Evangelist,” which he
had obtained in exchange for cuts. “What think
you of this?” said he. “See, it is written on vellum
with illuminated initials,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and has sixty-three pages.
And observe, it is copied with a pen: some patient
monk has toiled over this many a weary day in his
cell. But I have a plan which I think will be an
improvement, which is to engrave it as I did the
picture.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> <em>Vellum.</em> A finer kind of parchment or skin, rendered clear
and white for writing. <em>Illuminated initials.</em> Capital letters, commencing
a chapter or paragraph were said to be illuminated when
made large and painted in colors; often being ornamented with
delicate devices of flowers, birds or animals. The monks were
skilled in this adornment of books.</p></div>

<p>“Engrave a book! It would be delightful to have
one made by thine own skill!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and when once the blocks are engraved
for the book,&mdash;a block for a page, sixty-three blocks,
I can impress a score of books as well as one copy.”</p>

<p>“And thou canst sell books as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
monks!” cried Anna joyfully. “Neither wilt thou
be shut up in a cloister a year to copy one small
book; but I wouldn’t wonder when the blocks are
prepared, if thou couldst make a book in a day,
even saving time and earning money!”</p>

<p>“A likely matter truly! but we must not build
air-castles!” Sage advice for him to give who
was himself a castle-builder, as are all enthusiastic
people,&mdash;may they never be less; for what would
be done in this work-a-day world without the healthful
stimulus of the illusions of hope?</p>

<p>A small table in the sitting-room was at evening
a work-bench. It was neatly covered in the daytime,
and Anna’s work-box was on it. But the
inventor found it necessary to seek entire seclusion
for some of his processes, and secured, it is said, a
fitting place in the ruins of the St. Arbogast Monastery,
abandoned to the moles and the bats save
the part which was inhabited by the poor people of
the suburbs of Strasbourg; and there, in a forsaken
cloister, he established his secret study and work-shop,
whither he withdrew whenever his presence
could be spared from the front shop. Not even to
Anna did he divulge his hidden work. She was
content, knowing that in good time she would know
the result.</p>

<p>Evening came, and in the quiet home-room the
inventor commenced engraving the first page of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
“History of St. John,” carefully tracing the letters
on the smooth surface of the block, and imitating the
most approved copyist’s hand. As Anna watched
him, she thought them perfect, and with good reason.</p>

<p>Toil on, busy worker! Glorious things will follow
thy labor!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Day</span> after day Gutenberg busied himself with
his associates in various labors, except at intervals,
when he engraved blocks, enlivened by the
sprightly presence of Anna, or pursued his experiments
in the recesses of the monastery.</p>

<p>“How famously you get on!” said Anna, one
evening, as she counted his pile of finished blocks
while he wrought at his engraving.</p>

<p>There was a knock; and, in an instant, to the
consternation of both, Dritzhn and Hielman opened
the door, and, without ceremony, entered. Gutenberg
was surprised with block and graving tools in
hand, and the “Historia” open before him.</p>

<p>“Ah! what have we here?” asked Dritzhn, stepping
up to him; “something new in mystery?”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” replied the inventor, coloring,
“if I waive an explanation for the present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
“But,” said Hielman, drawing nearer and speaking
in excited tones,&mdash;for he was a close man in
money matters,&mdash;“thou didst engage to teach us
thy arts, if we would pay thee.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” answered Gutenberg, “that I did
covenant to show thee my arts of the lapidary and
mirror business, but that agreement did not cover
other arts which are only partly known to myself.”</p>

<p>“Be persuaded to do the fair thing, good master,”
said Dritzhn.</p>

<p>“In paying thee,” added Hielman, “we understood
that thou wouldst teach us all thy arts. We
want our money’s worth.”</p>

<p>“I have found it necessary,” observed Gutenberg,
not appearing to notice the remark, “to be favored
with quiet and seclusion in pursuing any new branch
of business, and I cannot succeed in this unless it
be kept a profound secret. Still money is needed
to carry it on.”</p>

<p>This only made Dritzhn more eager to learn the
nature of the enterprise; and he answered, “If
that be all, we can keep thy secret, furnish funds,
and perhaps help thee in the work.”</p>

<p>Gutenberg, with many misgivings, finally decided
to trust them, first obtaining from each a formal
pledge of secrecy. Then producing his cards and
cuts, he explained, step by step, the process of making
them. His callers expressed great interest and
admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
“I can be of service in executing the figures,”
said Dritzhn, “as I am a draughtsman.”</p>

<p>“You could assist me in that direction,” said
the inventor; “but I am now mostly engaged in
engraving tablets for books.”</p>

<p>“Making books by engraving!” exclaimed
Dritzhn. “When will the marvels cease?”</p>

<p>“I have invented a way of imprinting books by
a process unknown to any others. Only block
picture-books with inscriptions have approached the
idea.” Gutenberg then showed the “Historia” on
which he was working.</p>

<p>“Master,” cried Dritzhn in amazement, “a man
of such genius will surely realize a fortune! Why,
it would take the wages of a common artisan two
years to buy such a work; and you have a large
part of it done in a few weeks.” But Hielman,
afraid of new projects, was less sanguine.</p>

<p>“This will succeed,” urged Dritzhn aside to
him, “and we shall want a share in it. Since also
we know the secret, and have bound ourselves by
an oath, we cannot honorably turn back. It only
remains to aid Master Gutenberg to the extent of
our power.” Then turning to Gutenberg, he
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“But will not this art do away with copying?”</p>

<p>“Not at once,” replied Gutenberg. “But if
the copyists should get a hint of what this invention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
can do, they might seek to crush it. Moreover,
the art is only begun; I learn something
new day by day; and I have confided my secret
to you, that as a firm we may bring it to perfection.”</p>

<p>The sequel of the interview was that a written
contract was drawn up by Gutenberg, who was a
ready writer, and signed by them all, binding the
parties for the term of five years on two <span class="locked">conditions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>First, that they pay Gutenberg the sum of two
hundred and fifty florins; one hundred immediately,
and the remainder at a certain fixed period. Second,
that if any one of the partners should die
during the time of the copartnership, the survivors
should pay to his heirs the sum of one hundred
florins, in consideration of which the effects
should become the property of the surviving partners.</p>

<p>Other items followed; and, above all, the profoundest
secrecy was enjoined.</p>

<p>Business, however, went on as usual through the
day; and a customer chancing in Gutenberg’s work-shop
would not have dreamed of the existence of
the secret firm to prosecute the new art. Dritzhn
wrought as if in deep thought; but if at times he
seemed to loiter, he made out his quota of work ere
the day’s decline. Hielman polished as usual on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
mirrors; and Riffe, although burdened with the
secret, kept at work with his old cheerful whistle.</p>

<p>When evening came, a second conference was
held at the home-room of Gutenberg’s house, when
Riffe also took the oath of secrecy, and signed the
contract. But Gutenberg was oppressed with foreboding.
Since his hidden occupation of the engraved
blocks had been discovered by Dritzhn and
Hielman, he saw that others also might find it out.
On mentioning his anxiety to the firm, Dritzhn at
once replied that the business ought to be removed
to a more retired place, and made offer of his own
upper room. After examination, Gutenberg decided
to make the change, and a part of the engraving
apparatus was forthwith carried to that place.
In order, however, to cover appearances, and also
meet expenses, it was judged best for Hielman and
Riffe to continue the lapidary and mirror department,
as usual, in the front shop, while Gutenberg
and Dritzhn were to spend a portion of their time
in engraving blocks in the upper room of the latter,
although some of the work was still done, as before,
at the inventor’s cottage. This arrangement
seemed necessary to make the twofold occupations
thrive. Hielman and Riffe still needed much instruction
in gem and mirror polishing, and they had
also the advantage of regular lessons in engraving,
to which they were entitled by the articles of agreement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Gutenberg’s “Historia” was necessarily somewhat
hindered, as his attention was much occupied with
teaching Dritzhn in engraving blocks. As, however,
the latter had skill in drafting, he very readily
caught the ideas indispensable to the art,&mdash;accuracy
in drawing the figure, and a careful management
of the graver’s tool in cutting away the block
so as to leave the lines raised. Dritzhn made good
progress in figure-cutting on card-engraving, which
was the first lesson Gutenberg gave him; but in
attempting to engrave letters, he was not so skillful.</p>

<p>“That department of the art can only be acquired
by patience and labor,” said Gutenberg to
his pupil. “I therefore advise that you continue on
the figures.”</p>

<p>Thus pleasantly they wrought together, Dritzhn
on figures, and Gutenberg on letters, for he still
pursued the “History of St. John.” Hielman and
Riffe were quite awkward as pupils in the art. In
the first place, neither had any idea of drawing, and
Gutenberg was under the necessity of teaching them
the elements of that science; then they could not
read, and he must needs initiate them into the mysteries
of the alphabet. Anna came to the rescue,
or poor Gutenberg would have despaired of making
them engravers. She taught one his letters,
while her husband instructed the other in drawing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
straight and curved lines. Anna, after a time, hit
upon a short route to accomplish both together, and
required her pupil to draw a letter as soon as he
had learned it. In this way, what with the efforts
of Gutenberg, and the suggestions of Anna, they
soon made perceptible progress, and in due time
were familiar with the alphabet, and could draw it
passably well. While occupying most of their time
with the lapidary and mirror business, they still
gave several hours each day and evening to the
new art.</p>

<p>When Gutenberg advanced Riffe and Hielman
to engraving the letters which he had drawn, they
sadly blundered.</p>

<p>“What a world of patience you had, master,
when you worked through all this alone!” said
Hielman, showing his block, on which, after much
painstaking, he had cut a Y in the shape of a well-sweep.</p>

<p>“It is a wonder to me, master, how thou didst
discover this art, when it is such a labor for us to
learn it!” exclaimed Riffe; and he held up a B
which looked more like a camel.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing like trying,” said Gutenberg
pleasantly, as he went through the process of drawing
another letter for each. It was, however, a
source of great annoyance to him to have so many
blocks ruined by his workmen; and he bethought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
him of a way to prevent this waste, which was to
give them small strips of wood of little value, on
which to make their experiments in cutting letters,
which may have led to the idea of movable type.
Meanwhile, as he had time, he progressed with his
book. By dint of patient plodding, Dritzhn finished
the figures of the work, when Gutenberg had accomplished
the more toilsome labor of graving letters,
page by page.</p>

<p>The blocks of the “Historia” were completed,
and great was the joy of all parties,&mdash;none being
more enthusiastic than Anna, who thought doing
the work so quickly, scarcely less than a miracle.</p>

<p>“Now is my time to help,” said she; “I can
take the impressions!” Her husband smiled, and
Dritzhn looked incredulous, which made her more
eager to be of use in expediting the issue of the famous
“History.” Gutenberg gladly accepted her
proffer of aid, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We welcome thy assistance, my dear, and we
shall all be very busy. To-night we must fold and
cut the paper into the right size for pages, and also
grind the umber and make the ink, and to-morrow
we will commence impressing the leaves.”</p>

<p>Thus they wrought as busy as bees, and it proved
to be rare honey that they stored in those days of
patient toil,&mdash;honey for the world, which will never
be exhausted for all time, as our sequel will show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Gutenberg and Dritzhn impressed the pages from
the engraved blocks through the early part of the
next day, while Riffe and Hielman, as usual,
wrought in the front shop at the old trades. In the
afternoon Dritzhn relieved the two workmen, while
they with Anna assisted Gutenberg. After a little
practice, she could take impressions as well as her
husband; and when she wearied of this, she made a
strong paste, and under his direction commenced
pasting the blank sides of the leaves together, for
they were printed only on one side. In a few days
they had a number of “Histories” bound and ready
for sale. There was great rejoicing among those
early workers over the beautiful books which were
the result of their toil!</p>

<p>Now came the question how to dispose of them.
The firm finally concluded to exhibit them two or
three at a time in the front shop, and try the effect
on customers.</p>

<p>Gutenberg, remembering the experiment with
pictures, said little. He was, however, hopeful that
they could in some way make a market for the edition
in the course of a few weeks. If so, he felt
that it would be a triumph of block-printing over
copying.</p>

<p>But he was doubtful of the project of exhibiting
them in the way proposed, as the more books sold,
the less jewelry and mirrors. At length Peter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Schoeffer, a young man studying in Father Melchoir’s
school in an ante-room of the Cathedral, was
engaged to offer them for sale to the few learned
people in the place; for few, comparatively, knew
how to read.</p>

<p>As the books were valuable, and only small sales
could be expected, he was permitted to take only
one at a time. The first week he sold two copies;
and as one also was sold from the shop, the firm
took courage&mdash;it was a success! At this rate the
edition would speedily be disposed of.</p>

<p>Small Receipts.&mdash;Printing the “Donatus.”&mdash;“Ars Memorandi.”&mdash;“Ars
Moriendi.”&mdash;An Interesting Fact.&mdash;Extract
from “Ars Moriendi.”</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> time passed, the firm occasionally sold a copy
of the “History,” but receipts were smaller
than had been anticipated. Few of the common
people could read,&mdash;its circulation was therefore
mostly confined to the priests and nobility. The
former rarely needed to purchase it, as each one
could, if he desired, secure one of the kind by copying;
and trouble, expense, and time were involved
in gaining access to the higher classes.</p>

<p>Gutenberg consoled himself by reasoning that
his books would be called for gradually, and that he
must as soon as possible issue another work suitable
for a more accessible class. These were the youth
in the Cathedral, studying for the priesthood, who
were under the necessity of copying their “Donatuses,”
or manuals of grammar. Why should he not
prepare an edition for their use? He would be sure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
of some customers, and there would be no risk in
trying his hand at a “Donatus.” The firm at once
went to work upon the manual, which was one of
the first school-books adapted to beginners. The
children and youth of four hundred years ago had
few aids in study, and few were educated. The
voice of the living teacher, usually a priest, served
to make passable the otherwise inaccessible paths of
learning.</p>

<p>As the busy company wrought on the “Donatus,”
the curiosity of certain neighbors was excited respecting
the nature of their evening employment,
and it was deemed advisable more fully to remove
the hidden art to Dritzhn’s shop, from which printing-office
the new manuals of grammar in due time
were issued. They sold more readily than the “History,”
and the edition of fifty copies was soon exhausted.
Many of the scholars in the Cathedral
school bought them; and for a time Gutenberg and
his firm were busy in issuing and Peter Schoeffer
in circulating the work. The lapidary and mirror
arts were still pursued by turns, although very naturally
the firm felt more interest in the fascinating
occupation of imprinting. After a few weeks the
demand for the “Donatus” almost ceased, the
pupils in Strasbourg and vicinity having been supplied,
and the means of communication with other
places being infrequent. There were no newspapers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and none of the methods of advertising now
in vogue with publishers. Still the company was
not discouraged; the sale of one book was a greater
event then than is now the sale of many thousands.</p>

<p>The call for the “Donatus” declining, the inventor
turned his attention to a work of quite a different
description, which was a great favorite with the
more devout monks. This was the “Ars Memorandi,”
or “Art of Remembering.” We have no means
of ascertaining the size of this book; but it could not
have been large, as almost in immediate connection
with it were engraved the blocks of a religious and
devotional work called “Ars Moriendi,” or the “Art
of knowing how to Die.” The numerous engravings
illustrating these books, Gutenberg seems to
have omitted.</p>

<p>These were comparatively new works, the first
book having only been written in 1420, followed by
other copies in 1430. Gutenberg’s block edition
was a great improvement on these, and soon became
popular, being suited to the religious wants of the
people.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that the second book,
“Ars Moriendi,” continued to engage attention for
many years. It is also probable that it was the
identical work on which Caxton, the first English
printer, was engaged the last day of his life, the
15th of June, 1490, when he was about eighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
years of age. The work at that time bore the title
“The Art and Craft to know well to Die.”</p>

<p>If so, we have the inventor of printing himself,
when comparatively a young man, issuing this important
work, and the first English printer crowning
his life-labors in bringing it before the world.
The thoughtful and religious tone of this book may
be gathered from the following passage from the
<span class="locked">preface:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“When it is so that what a man maketh or doeth,
it is made to come to some end, and if the thing be
good or well made, it must needs come to good end;
then by better and greater reason every man ought
to intend in such wise to live in this world, in keeping
the commandments of God, that he may come
to a good end. Then out of this world, full of
wretchedness and tribulations, he may go to heaven
unto God and his saints, unto joy ever durable.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is an interesting fact in the history of printing
that its discoverer was led to issue works of an
excellent and devotional character. As time passed,
numbers were disposed of to the nobility, and occasionally
one to some favored tradesman who had
conquered his alphabet. Those who had purchased
the “History of St. John,” wished a copy; and families
enriched with a “Donatus,” cast about them to
devise ways and means to buy the newer works of
Gutenberg.</p>

<p>But what changes these books effected in the
households blessed with their presence! “A man
is known by the company he keeps;” and books
are most influential associates. People who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
not dreamed of being able to buy a book, by the
skill of Gutenberg suddenly found themselves enriched
with the treasure. How the reader of the
family dwelt on the magic page! for seldom it was
that more than one member could read. How the
little circle gathered round the fireside of an evening,
listening to catch each word of the wonderful
volume, which was read and re-read, discussed,
approved, and mostly committed to memory. This
eagerness of the more enlightened classes to own
and read a book, may seem strange to us who all
our lives long have been surrounded with books of
all sizes, from the abstruse tome we pore over to
understand, to the charming literary favorite that
we read once and again with delight.</p>

<p>But our wonder will cease when we remember
what a different state of things then existed. Books
were so scarce,&mdash;and this very scarcity increased
their value,&mdash;then they were made with pen and
ink alone, except by Gutenberg, who kept the secret
of his block process. People took it for granted
that the books he sold them were manuscripts, slowly
written by hand; and marveled much at their
exactness and similarity.</p>

<p>Still, with all the interest excited by his books, an
edition of some fifty copies, sufficed to answer the
demand. The mass of the people were too ignorant
to aspire to the possession of a book. They could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
not read, and reasoned&mdash;if the subject came up&mdash;that
books would be useless. To buy them,
would be like purchasing a carriage when horses
could not be had to draw it, or spectacles for a
blind man, or shoes for one without feet.</p>

<p>As was his custom, whenever a new book was
issued, the inventor visited the Cathedral with the
“Ars Moriendi” to make sales. The visit was an
event of moment to the firm, far more than a trade
sale is to a publishing house of this day.</p>

<p>He first sought the Abbot in the library, whom
he found sitting a little apart by a table, busily examining
the work of the copyists.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, holy Father!” said Gutenberg.</p>

<p>“Good-morrow, my son: hast thou brought more
of thy wonderful books?”</p>

<p>“That I have, Father,” replied Gutenberg; and
as he began to remove the coverings, several monks
gathered around him.</p>

<p>“What hast thou here?” asked Father Gottlieb,
a gray-headed friar; “more of thy magical books?”</p>

<p>“I claim no powers of magic, Father; it is simply
patience that has done it!” and opening an “Ars
Memorandi,” he passed it to the critical monk.
Then taking a copy of “Ars Moriendi” he courteously
presented it to the Superior.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my son!” rejoined his Reverence
graciously. “It is a pleasure to examine thy manuscript.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
“Curious book!” exclaimed Father Melchoir, a
middle-aged monk, who had himself just finished
a copy of the same work, by the slow process of the
pen, with incredible pains and much time. “How
came you to make so many books all alike?
How did you do it? You have a great company
of scribes, eh?”</p>

<p>Gutenberg did not explain. Meanwhile the
monks continued to gather; for having seen some
of the former issues of the lapidary, they were the
more eager to examine the new one.</p>

<p>“Very good! wonderful!” said one, as he turned
over the pages of a book.</p>

<p>“It is not like the work of our hands,” added
another.</p>

<p>“But you have not answered my questions!”
persisted Father Melchoir, piqued that Gutenberg
made such a show of industry and careful penmanship.</p>

<p>“I can even tell thee that I have accomplished
it by patience,” was the inventor’s reply.</p>

<p>“Why, we claim not to be wanting in that virtue,”
said Father Melchoir, “but none of us can compete
with your speed in writing. Every few weeks you
bring us in twelve or more books, all carefully
written out in half the time it takes our readiest
scribe to make one copy!”</p>

<p>“Moreover,” added another, as he compared two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
copies, “the letters are so exact and regular; why,
these two copies have just as many letters and
words on a page, made precisely alike!”</p>

<p>“But, the books are unadorned!” broke in
Father Melchoir. “And very plain and poverty-stricken
they look to me after gazing on our illuminated
books, with their beautiful pictures, rich
bindings, silk embroidered with gold and silver
thread, and their backs of ivory exquisitely carved,
or embellished with filigree-work and pearls and
precious stones. One would suppose that a lapidary
might at least use ornaments that are in his
line!”</p>

<p>“I am not ambitious of adornment,” answered
Gutenberg. “I would greatly prefer to circulate
twelve books in a neat plain dress than one in rich
pictures and binding. My twelve books are made
to be read; while an embellished copy is only fit to
be locked up with clasps, and kept in a chest or
cage, to be taken out on great occasions.”</p>

<p>The Superior meanwhile had been absorbed in
the copy Gutenberg had presented him, and appeared
not to notice the conversation. He now
motioned the monks to withdraw; then, turning to
Gutenberg, <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I have a word to thee, my son!”</p>

<p>“I am ready to hear, holy Father!”</p>

<p>“Are these books made with the pen of the copyist?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and his keen eye fell on the lapidary with a
searching glance.</p>

<p>Gutenberg was embarrassed for an answer.</p>

<p>“It is as I supposed,” continued the Superior.
“They are made by engraved blocks, like the ‘St.
Christopher’ and the ‘Biblia Pauperum.’”</p>

<p>Gutenberg saw that his secret was out; but his
consternation was allayed when the Father added,
“It may be that we can furnish you with a work to
engrave and imprint. How would you like to undertake
with the ‘Biblia Pauperum?’ The copy
which belongs to our library is rudely executed, and
I doubt not you would greatly improve upon it. It
is so rough and uncouth that I sometimes think the
original manuscript copy made by Ausgarius in the
ninth century must have been a better specimen
of art. Think the matter over, my son, and let me
know your decision at an early day.”</p>

<p>Gutenberg took leave, and on reaching home
consulted the rest of the company about imprinting
a new issue of the “Biblia Pauperum.” It chanced
that not one of the firm had seen the book, with the
exception of Andreas Dritzhn, who once examined
the copy in the Cathedral. He was in favor of
engaging in the work, if the monks would take
copies enough to pay them well for their labor.
This was a point which Gutenberg was deputed to
ascertain, that there might be no risk in devoting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the requisite time to perfect the engraving,&mdash;an
undertaking of no small magnitude.</p>

<p>Accordingly, shortly after, Gutenberg made
another visit to the Cathedral to confer with the
Superior. He met with a cordial greeting, and
almost abruptly the Father <span class="locked">began:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“And what is thy decision, son Gutenberg; wilt
thou prepare for us new copies of the ‘Biblia Pauperum?’”</p>

<p>“I shall rejoice to engage in the enterprise,” was
the reply, “if I can do so without too much risk,
but it will be a slow and toilsome undertaking,
involving much <span class="locked">expense”&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Which you will be paid for when it is finished.”</p>

<p>“But who will buy the book?”</p>

<p>“A goodly number of priests will need copies,”
replied the Father. “The forty curious pictures of
which the book is composed, were designed to illustrate
a series of skeleton sermons. They are of
great use in stirring the preacher’s imagination, and
storing his memory with excellent texts. The
book, therefore, is mainly suited to the different
religious orders, and will have sale chiefly among
them. Still, as it is taken from the Bible, and
called the ‘Bible for the Poor,’ others will buy it besides
the priests, and it may have a wide circulation.
Numbers will be needed to give the monks each a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
chance to examine it as often as is desirable, although
the different copies will be chained in cages,
or on tablets, that no person may appropriate one
solely to his own use.”</p>

<p>This was an era in the affairs of Gutenberg. His
art was acknowledged and patronized by the Superior,
and he himself really promoted above the
monks, who were prominent not only among the
book-makers or book-sellers, but the literati of their
day. Still Gutenberg, as he called to mind the
jealousy of Father Melchoir, feared fully to rely on
patronage from the friars; and it was only the assurance
of the worthy Superior that induced him
to engage in the expensive enterprise of bringing
out a new “Biblia Pauperum.”</p>

<p>“Tarry a little,” said the Abbot, as the lapidary
was leaving; “I will lend thee our ‘Biblia,’ for a
copy.” Then going to the side of the room where
the light streamed in from a lofty painted window,
he unlocked a cage, and taking the valued book
from a gilded bracket, unfastened the chain which
confined it to the wall, and, carefully wrapping it in
paper, gave it to Gutenberg, who hastened away,
intent on the new project before him.</p>

<p>Dritzhn had become a skillful engraver, but it
was necessary to secure the services of two other
wood-engravers, residing in Strasbourg, to whom
the subjects were carried,&mdash;cuts being taken from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the “Biblia” and given to them, one by one, as they
could execute them. In this way the pictures were
finished in the course of a few months. Gutenberg,
Riffe, and Hielman engraved the inscriptions explaining
the cuts, of which those at the top and bottom
of the page consisted of Scripture and Leonine
verses, so called from Leo, the inventor, the end of
each line rhyming with the middle, as for <span class="locked">example:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The engraving of this “Poor Man’s Bible” was
a great work; and only the invincible energy, enthusiasm,
and perseverance of those early artisans
enabled them to accomplish it in so short a time.
To form some idea of its magnitude, we must keep
in mind that each page contained four busts, or
figures of persons; the two upper ones represented
the prophets, or others whose names were beneath
them; the two lower figures are unknown, or can
only be conjectured. In the middle of the pages,
which are all marked by letters from the alphabet,
were three historical pictures, one of which was
from the New Testament.</p>

<p>A fac-simile of this curious and ancient work can
be seen in the Public Library, Boston, and will
richly repay the trouble of examination. This has,
however, forty-eight engravings, which may indicate
that the work, as first issued by Ausgarius in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
ninth century, was comparatively meagre, and
grew to its present proportions by successive issues
and by the hand of different artists.</p>

<p>In due time the firm was busy in imprinting and
binding the choice volume, delighted with the good
prospect of remuneration for it; and as soon as one
copy was completed, Gutenberg again betook him
to the Cathedral to exhibit it to the Abbot, who
was warm in his praise of the work.</p>

<p>“This is as I would have it,” said he, with a
beaming face, “it is elegantly executed, and more in
keeping with the themes which it illustrates. Our
priests will now have no excuse for stupid sermons
when they officiate in the chapel or cathedral.
Thou hast done nobly, and thy labors will subserve
the interests of the Church.”</p>

<p>He then bestowed on him a generous sum, as an
earnest of the full amount, when the copies he had
engaged, were delivered; and Gutenberg, with a
happy heart, despite the glance he had of Father
Melchoir’s frowning visage, returned to his cottage
to rejoice with Anna.</p>

<p>“It is just as I anticipated,” she exclaimed. “I
knew thou wouldst triumph. Only to think, a real
‘Biblia Pauperum’ made by my John Gutenberg!
I am proud and happy; we shall yet see good days.
Then it will so enliven us to have a copy in the
house, for I have thy promise of one of each book
thou mayst make.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
“Aye, my Anna, that is as little as I can do;
when I get rich, I hope to add to thy wardrobe, as
well as to our library;” and he glanced painfully at
her plain russet gown, for through all his experiments
she had practiced a rigid economy in dress.</p>

<p>“When thou art rich,” replied Anna, “I will
not refuse the gifts thy kind heart inclines thee to
give; but for the present, I am content.”</p>

<p>The “Biblia” sold better than any previous
work, and Gutenberg and partners were much
gratified. They did not, however, realize as much
money as if they had kept to the lapidary and
mirror business. The demand for books was so
small, a market had to be created; and this required
time and the slow progress of events.</p>

<p>But so much pleased were they with their endeavors,
that, sanguine of still better success, they
soon issued one of the books of the Bible entire.
This was the Canticles, or Solomon’s Song, and,
like the “Biblia Pauperum,” printed only on one
side of the page from engraved wooden blocks.
A copy of this work is carefully treasured among
antiquities in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Such was the estimation in which it was held as
a work of art, and such its sale, that Gutenberg was
led to attempt greater things; he even conceived
the idea of printing the entire Bible. Anna was
greatly in favor of the undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
“All thou wouldst have to do,” said she, vivaciously,
“would be to make more blocks,&mdash;a block
for a page; and it would be so much better than
copying. For a monk, if he lives to a good old
age, and is diligent with his pen, can only write
out two Bibles; and printing from blocks is much
greater speed than that.”</p>

<p>“True, Anna,” was the reply; “but hast thou
an idea how long it would take to engrave the
blocks for the entire Bible?”</p>

<p>“Nay; but thou art so expert that assuredly it
would not take thee long,&mdash;a few months, I suppose,
at farthest. I do hope that thou wilt commence
on this work at once. It is so desirable to
have the Bible issued by thy art.”</p>

<p>“But let us calculate a little, my dear Anna.
There are seven hundred pages in the Bible. By
close application, I cannot engrave carefully and
suitably more than two pages a month; and I must
be full three hundred and fifty months, or nearly
thirty years, in engraving blocks enough for the
Holy Book!”</p>

<p>“Why, that would be dreadful!” cried Anna in
dismay. “Thou wouldst be an old man long before
it was done; it would even take thy life-time!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Anna, and this process of engraving fine
letters on blocks, when pursued closely, is dimming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
to the eyes; I should be blind before my work was
half done.”</p>

<p>“But thou couldst divide thy labors with thy
workmen, couldst thou not?”</p>

<p>“Aye, if I can persuade them to undertake so
formidable an enterprise. But the men are getting
weary of large works, and beg me to choose smaller
ones; they assert that the new process is no better
for a large book than copying. Perhaps, however,
we can issue the Gospels gradually, by taking one
book at a time.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps thou canst,” echoed Anna sadly.</p>

<p>Although Gutenberg was depressed when he
thought of the immense labor involved in imprinting
so large a work as the Bible, yet he was not
wholly disheartened. This was the secret of his
success; he would not give up; was not frightened
by difficulties; what the faint-hearted would deem
impossible, he feared not to attempt. The art of
printing would have remained undiscovered until
this day without this courageous perseverance.</p>

<p>Gutenberg said nothing to his associates about
attempting the execution of the whole Bible; indeed,
he dared not entertain the idea himself; but
he proposed that they publish the Gospels. They
thought this too large a work. He replied that
they could imprint the Gospel of St. Matthew, and
do as seemed best about the remainder; this was
complete in itself, and would find a ready sale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Accordingly they were soon hard at the task
of engraving blocks for the Gospel of Matthew.
Dritzhn demurred, as he mechanically toiled away,
saying, “Unless prospects brighten, we shall never
get back our money.”</p>

<p>Fault-finding is contagious; and Hielman and
Riffe soon manifested a similar spirit. Those were
gloomy days. Gutenberg meanwhile said little, but
wrought at his block with renewed vigor. It was
nearly completed; a few turns and gashes of the
keen-pointed instrument, and it would be done;
when by a slip of the hand the wood was split
asunder!</p>

<p>Dritzhn looked up aghast, as much as to say,
“How can we afford this great waste of time and
labor?” Gutenberg’s quick eye interpreted the
glance, and his ingenuity was put to the test of repairing
the loss. He commenced fitting the block
together in order to save some of the work at least.
While thus engaged, the thought occurred to him,
What if the carved block were broken up into separate
letters, so that they might be put together in
any words desired?</p>

<p>He seized his knife and split the wood into the
letters carved on its surface. Thus he had wooden
type, which he arranged in various words. The
light of a great invention had dawned. Absorbed
in thoughts of its advantages, he heeds not the curious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
eyes of his comrades, as they intently regard
him, wondering at his apparently aimless performance.</p>

<p>He was a philosopher, and in his search after the
natural and practical came to reason <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I want a system of impressing characters suited
to the language. In Latin there are twenty-four
letters, and the same letters are used over and over
to spell many thousands of words. In a page of
words I employ portions of the alphabet a number
of times; and after I have done printing with the
block, the carved letters are lost. If I could contrive
a way of separating them, I could rearrange
them without cutting new ones, and apply them to
another page of different matter.</p>

<p>“I must, then, have my letters for printing, separate,
like the letters of the alphabet, so that I can
handle them as readily as I use letters to form
words. I must carve the letters in wood with little
handles to them, that I may take them up, and
place them together as if I were spelling!”</p>

<p>Thus did the patient hero seize upon the idea of
movable type,&mdash;the key-stone of the art of printing.
He soon tried another experiment; splitting
a block into strips, and working it down to the right
size, he carved a letter on the end of it. This cost
him care and labor, for it was more difficult than
engraving on the solid block. Many bits of wood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
were carved before he succeeded in getting a letter
to suit him. But after many trials he made one,
then another, and another, taking pains to form the
sticks of the right thickness, so that when they
were placed together, the letters would not be too
far apart.</p>

<p>When he had the alphabet carved, each letter on
the end of a little wooden peg, he had twenty-four
type letters,&mdash;quite a little pile,&mdash;which he regarded
with pride and satisfaction, and called them
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i>, or type. Like a child in his first efforts in
reading, so he carefully spelt his way onward.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bonus homo</i>, “a good man,” were the words he
first tried with his type. Taking the bits of wood
with the letters <em>bonus</em>, he placed them one after
the other as he spelt the word, and fastened them
together with a string. But when he came to the
next word, as he had only one <em>o</em>, he stopped and
made two more before the word could be set up.
As he tried other words, he found that he needed
more letters; so, taking time, he cut out a large
number of types for each letter in the alphabet.
These he placed separately in little boxes to prevent
them from being mixed. There was the box of
A’s, the box of B’s, the box of C’s, and so on for
all the letters. This was a font of movable type,
the first ever made, and the great step of progress
in his invention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
If you will try the experiment of cutting type out
of wood, you will more readily perceive the difficulties
attending it. It was the work of months to accomplish
this, which we have noted in two or three
pages.</p>

<p>As Gutenberg went on setting up <em>bonus</em> in type,
he found an obstacle in keeping the letters together,
so that he could rub ink on them and print. Evening
came, and he took them home to remedy the
difficulty, and notched the edges of the two outside
letters, the <em>b</em>, and the <em>s</em>, that he might tie them
firmly with the linen thread he had provided.
This fastening them together, that they might bear
the impression of the solid block, was also a study;
but he was not to be turned aside by obstacles. He
had energy, courage, perseverance, and ingenuity;
for Providence was inspiring him for his work.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> for Anna, usually so hopeful, she was much
disquieted when her husband told her that
block-printing was only suited to small books, and
that some other method must be sought out, or he
could not issue large works. She had her heart on
retrieving their affairs by the sale of books, and
was bitterly disappointed that the new art could
not at once, if ever, bring the hoped for prosperity.</p>

<p>Dritzhn’s life was embittered with vain regrets;
each hour of the day was vocal with his murmurs
and forebodings. Under these circumstances, Gutenberg
did not feel free to take his rightful share
of the small profits, and, in consequence, the allowance
for family expenses was not sufficient to furnish
his home with comforts and keep Want, the gaunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
wolf, away. And so it came about that one day
Anna sat sewing in her dwelling, the picture of
grief, and bitterly reproaching herself for the advice
she had given her husband to turn aside from
the sure returns of the artisan to the uncertainties
of invention. The garment she was making fell
from her hands, and she <span class="locked">exclaimed,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Alas! I am the foolish woman that plucketh her
house down with her hands! I had not the wisdom
to give my husband good counsel!” Thus she bewailed
herself with bitter tears and reproaches till
evening, when, hearing Gutenberg’s step as he returned
from St. Arbogast, she quickly wiped away
her tears, and strove to meet him with composure.</p>

<p>“Why, Anna!” he cried, as he beheld her
woe-begone face, “art thou ill? Are our friends
dead? Speak, and tell me!” And as she revealed
the source of her disquiet, he said <span class="locked">cheerily,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My Anna, thou must take a juster view of
things. Brighter days are in store for us. Thou
dost not know what I have discovered!”</p>

<p>“But I know too well what <em>I</em> have discovered,”
she rejoined; “it is that we are beggars. There is no
food in the house, and I can go no more to the provision
merchants until they are paid. It is dreadful
to think how we have spent our money!” To
such an extremity of speech was poor Anna brought
in her trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
“O Anna! Anna!” exclaimed Gutenberg, distressed
for her, “dost thou see these bits of wood?
I have cut a letter on the end of each. I fasten
them together thus;” and he held up the type of
the word <em>bonus</em>. “I ink them, and press them on
paper thus. See how beautifully they print;” and
he showed the word impressed in clear characters.</p>

<p>“But is it not presumption to trust longer to uncertainties?”
cried Anna; “they cannot bring food
into the house. We are poor.”</p>

<p>“My Anna,” soothingly said the kind husband,
“dost thou forget that I have conceived a great invention,
and that thou art really as rich as a queen?”</p>

<p>“O, the wild dream!” returned Anna, smiling
through her tears, comforted by his sympathy, “I
shall trust it when it pays our debts, and feeds and
clothes us. We are verily poor, and I see not how
vain imaginings can help us.”</p>

<p>“But, dear, my patrimony is not all gone. I have
land still unsold at Mentz; and as I cannot realize
money from these immediately, I promise thee that
if this invention does not help our affairs in a month,
I will relinquish it for the present, and return to
polishing gems for a livelihood.”</p>

<p>It was a rough and thorny way that the inventor
trod, reaching after that great gift which God held
out to man, and no wonder that Anna, in this time
of trial, pleaded with him to turn back, watering
his path with her tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Gutenberg slept little the night of the revelation
of movable type. He deemed the invention most
important; and before his mind, stimulated to unusual
action, some of the great changes which
would ensue from his discovery, were dimly portrayed.
Like the prophets who understood not the
full import of their own utterances, but inquired
diligently to know what the spirit which was in
them did signify, so the discoverer of the wonderful
art could only hope that it was the introduction
of something glorious; and that hope was thenceforth
his guiding star amid the darkness of his
earthly lot. With the first ray of morning he was
at his work, to test more fully the new types. Setting
them up, he fastened them together, and printed
the same words as before. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bonus homo</i> shone with
the halo of <em>eureka</em> to Gutenberg’s eye. “I have
found it!” he exclaimed, and, starting off to market,
brought home food for the day.</p>

<p>Gustav Nieritz, a German writer, thus describes
Gutenberg’s <span class="locked">progress:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“He set to work with the utmost eagerness. Out
of a piece of hard wood he sawed some thousand
tiny blocks, a few inches long, and very narrow.
At one end he cut a letter in relief, and bored a
hole through the other. After having thus furnished
himself with a considerable number of the letters
of the alphabet, he placed whole words together,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and arranged them in lines on a string, until they
formed a page, when he bound them together with
wire, and so prevented their falling asunder. He
then blackened his wooden type with ink, and taking
up the whole together, pressed upon it a sheet of
paper. And now let us place ourselves in his position,
and enter into his feelings as he beheld the
first fruits of his long, unwearied labors.</p>

<p>“With a trembling hand he caught up the printed
paper. It had succeeded beyond his expectation.
Tears ran down his cheeks as he gazed on it
with ecstacy. It was the Lord’s Prayer, with which
he had made almost his first attempt at printing
with types.</p>

<p>“Often had his lips uttered the words of prayer,
whilst he was thinking only of his invention; now,
however, their meaning came clearly upon his mind,
and his grateful soul turned fervently to the Father
of all light, from whom this light also had come,
which would enlighten men as no other human invention
could do. He fell upon his knees, holding
the sheet of paper in both hands, and repeated the
prayer it contained with his whole heart. O! it
was not for the sake of worldly gain that he rejoiced
in his discovery. It was that it freed him from the
debt that he had long ago incurred. He might be
called a dreamer and an idler: he neither heard
nor regarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
“‘Anna!’ he cried, throwing his arms round her,
‘here is the gold brocade cap, and all the rest besides
which I promised you. I have succeeded, and
our fortune is made.’ His wife shook her head
incredulously, and said with a <span class="locked">sigh:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘I wish you would give up these fancies, and
return to your work.’ Gutenberg smiled, but persevered.”</p>

<p>“My Anna!” said the inventor, some little time
later, as he showed her other specimens of his work,
“I trust that our poverty will soon be over. You
shall yet ride in a coach, and dine like a queen.
My invention is a certainty.”</p>

<p>“I only wish comforts and a competence,” returned
Anna tearfully.</p>

<p>“We are sure of both,” replied he, “Let me tell
thee, wife, nothing yet invented by man, ever made
such inroads on ignorance as this will effect. Almost
everything we know, we have acquired through the
medium of either spoken or written language. The
mass of the people are only acquainted with the former.
Everybody will, by and by, learn to read and
understand written language, and the knowledge
locked up in cloisters will be freely poured out to
the thirsty multitudes. It is through language that
we become wiser and better; and if my discovery
succeeds, as it must, the knowledge of the arts,
sciences, and religion will be sooner or later spread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
abroad. Then, no more hoarding of libraries that
kings, prelates, and priests alone may read; but the
common people, too, will have their books.” Anna
listened with pleased interest, and he went on:
“God has bestowed great honor on books, as some
of the devout authors say, in communicating with us
through them; and if holy men of old who spoke as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost had not written
down what God taught them, where to-day would
be our knowledge of our sacred things? And if it
was important for God to record his will, may we
not suppose that He will give wisdom so that a way
may be devised to publish his Word with facility?”</p>

<p>“I must think so, my Anna,” he added, “and I
cannot doubt that He has given me skill in what I
have undertaken. It grieves me to think what you
must have suffered through it, but I trust our days
of mourning are ended;” and his happy smile lightened
her heart like a sunbeam.</p>

<p>It was still quite early in the day when Gutenberg
repaired to Dritzhn’s shop, to exhibit to his
associates his invention of separate types. As he
entered, he was struck with the settled gloom that
rested on Dritzhn’s face. “My improvement has
occurred in good time,” thought the inventor; “my
partners are getting discouraged.”</p>

<p>“I have something new to show you,” said he to
Dritzhn, who was busy engraving the first verses
of the third chapter of Matthew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
“New things have nearly ruined us!” retorted
Dritzhn, looking up moodily from his work.</p>

<p>“But this is a new method of imprinting, which
will save much of our labor,” said Gutenberg,
showing the specimens of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bonus homo</i> and the
“Lord’s Prayer.”</p>

<p>“How does this mode differ from ours?” asked
Dritzhn. “You impress with the block, do you
not?”</p>

<p>“Nay; I first make letters on bits of wood, tie
them together to impress with, and, after using
them, take them apart, and set them up for new
words.”</p>

<p>“And this tying together and taking apart would
consume time,” objected Dritzhn. “I see no advantage
in this mode; in my opinion, it would involve
us more deeply.”</p>

<p>“But let us try it,” interposed Hielman; “if it
will save labor, it is a good thing.”</p>

<p>“Leave well enough alone! I think we shall do
better to keep on as we have begun,” said Riffe,
with the air of one who had settled the matter.</p>

<p>“Block-printing is by no means to be despised,”
answered Gutenberg, “in books of a few pages;
but in a large book of many pages, we waste time
in cutting letters, as they are only of use for that
book, and cannot be taken apart and used for another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
“I am opposed to any change,” Dritzhn reiterated;
“we are sufficiently involved without any
new experiments. We cannot do better than keep
on with the block books.”</p>

<p>Gutenberg had failed in convincing these men,
but he was confident that the practical working of
his separate types would yet be an argument they
could not resist. He persevered in his experiments,
and, in place of engraving on the block, busied himself
in adjusting and readjusting his type for the
“Lord’s Prayer,” as he found a difficulty in keeping
them in place, when he took a second impression.</p>

<p>Dritzhn and Riffe, having little fellowship for
this new way of “spending time,” were ready to
criticise when the types slipped out of place, as
Gutenberg tied them with thread or twine. But
before the day was over, he had managed to take
several good impressions of the “Lord’s Prayer.”
This was well enough, Dritzhn said, but still insisted
that he did not see how it was better than if
taken with an engraved block, and was in no mood
to investigate the matter with candor.</p>

<p>The partners had previously decided to publish
the “Speculum Humanæ Salutis,” and they now
commenced upon it. The “Speculum” suited both
parties, as there were plenty of subjects requiring
wood-engravings, and the movable type could also
be used in the written portion of the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
As Gutenberg wrought at his types, he had still
to combat the difficulty of making them hold together
with sufficient firmness. At first he used
strings, then wires. These were easily displaced,
and cost him many a hard job of repairing damages,
which confirmed Dritzhn and Riffe in the
opinion that it was useless to attempt to make them
work. It was not reasonable, the former said, that
such bits of wood could be made serviceable in
book-making. There was some sense in a solid
block, and his advice was to keep on in the old
way, with which, however, he was often finding
fault, for he had enlisted in the enterprise not
so much for the love of the art as the love of
money. Months of toil and large expenditures
had brought comparatively small returns. Some
of the firm even began to talk of returning to
the old occupation of polishing stones. Riffe continued
to echo Dritzhn’s criticisms and complaints.</p>

<p>“Why not keep on with block-printing?” asked
the latter, as Gutenberg was busy cutting out his
type, or <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i> as it was called. “I’ve just got my
hand in, and do not wish to give up the trade for
whittling sticks, of which I do not see the use.”</p>

<p>“Let me try once more to explain the use,”
pleasantly replied Gutenberg. “Suppose the letters
of the alphabet were tied together so that you
could not separate them, how could you spell words?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
The letters on a block cannot be taken apart to
form other words; but with the separate types it is
very different;” and to illustrate his meaning he set
up a word in type, printed with it, took the letters
apart, or “distributed” them, and framed another
word.</p>

<p>Although slow to be convinced, his associates
finally acknowledged the necessity of movable type
and began to acquire some degree of skill in making
them.</p>

<p>An advance on the method by cords and wire,
was Gutenberg’s invention of a frame with wedges
to keep the types in place. This had the approbation
of his partners. It was a great gain, and there
was much congratulation when he succeeded in
firmly adjusting the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i> so that they had all the
advantage of the solid block, with none of its disadvantages.</p>

<p>Taking impressions of the type on paper by friction
was slow and unsatisfactory; and Gutenberg,
after many experiments, contrived a press to imprint
with, and employed a skillful mechanic to make it.
This saved, besides other labor, the trouble of pasting
the blank backs of the leaves together, as both
sides of the paper were imprinted.</p>

<p>A distinguished writer, who assures us that he
has had access to the archives of Strasbourg, thus
vividly describes this discovery; “Months and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
years had been consumed&mdash;his fortune also and the
funds of the association&mdash;in patient experiments,
in successes, and in reverses. At length, having
made a small model of a <em>press</em> which appeared
to him to combine all the conditions of printing as
he then understood it, he hid the precious miniature
under his cloak, and, entering the city, went to a
skillful turner in wood and in metal, named Conrad
Sachspach, who dwelt at Merchants’ Cross-roads, to
ask him to make one of a large size. He left the
secret in the machine, only telling him that it was
a contrivance by which he proposed to accomplish
some <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chefs d’œuvre</i> of art and mechanics of which
a slower process was known. The artisan, taking,
turning, and re-turning the model in his hands,
with a smile of disdain at the rough sketch completed
by Gutenberg, said to him, with a bantering
<span class="locked">air:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“‘This is only a simple wine-press that you ask
me to make, Master John!’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ replied Gutenberg in a serious and dignified
tone, ‘it is a wine-press in effect, but it is a
press from which shortly shall sprout forth floods of
the most abundant and the most marvelous liquor
that has ever flowed to quench the thirst of man.
By it God shall spread his Word; from it shall
flow a fountain-head of pure truth. As a new star,
it shall dissipate the darkness of ignorance, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
cause to shine on men a light hitherto unknown!’
He withdrew. The mechanic, who understood
nothing of these words, executed the machine, and
returned it to Gutenberg at the monastery of Arbogast.
This was the first press.</p>

<p>“In giving it into the hands of Gutenberg, the
workman began to suspect some mystery. ‘I see
clearly, Master John,’ said he to Gutenberg, ‘that
you are indeed in communication with celestial
spirits; so hereafter I shall obey you as one of them&mdash;as
a spirit!’”</p>

<p>This first press, contrived in the gloomy recesses
of the old monastery, was set up in the printing
rooms of Dritzhn’s dwelling, but was not at first
fully appreciated.</p>

<p>Two years passed, the company cutting a supply
of movable type. Some sales were effected, but
financial affairs were not flattering.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a new cause of disturbance occurred
to impede progress, and waken in Gutenberg’s partners
doubts of his uniform infallibility in invention.</p>

<p>It was discovered that ink softened the type, and
injured the shape of the letters.</p>

<p>Riffe, one of the first to notice it, became
alarmed.</p>

<p>“It is my mind,” said he, “that the bubble has
burst. We may as well give up, and engage in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
our old trade. These uncertainties will never bring
grist to the mill.”</p>

<p>“The type does not print as well after it becomes
softened by the ink?” said Dritzhn inquiringly to
Gutenberg.</p>

<p>“We must expect difficulties,” was the reply,
“and seek to overcome them. We must make
more fresh type until we can contrive a way of
hardening the wood.”</p>

<p>At this the firm murmured against him afresh;
nor were they better satisfied as time went on, and
“John Dunnius’ bill of one hundred florins was
sent in for press-work.”</p>

<p>“Monstrous!” exclaimed Hielman; “we can
never afford it.”</p>

<p>“It is all pay out in this business,” Dritzhn added,
“and almost nothing coming in to balance the
loss.”</p>

<p>“Wait a little,” was Gutenberg’s reply; “we
are now sowing the seed; by and by we shall reap
our harvests.” And he further appeased their agitation
by calling attention to the satisfactory working
of the press, and reminded them of the great
service it was to them.</p>

<p>“Do you not see,” said he, “that our labor of
making <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i> is nearly useless without the frame
and press? We must either give up the art, and
disband, or make the necessary improvements as
they are called for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
While feeling keenly the murmurings of his associates,
most indomitable was the spirit that he
cherished, having the indispensable attribute of
the true inventor,&mdash;a passion for his calling, and
confidence in ultimate success.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Poor</span> Dritzhn! he was sadly lacking in the
spirit which upheld Gutenberg. He was a
plain matter-of-fact man, with none of the originator,&mdash;content
to plant in the spring and reap in
the autumn, to work in time-worn paths; but dubious
things that were years in maturing, were not
suited to his nature. The possibility of failure poisoned
his enjoyment, palsied his hand, and enfeebled
his step. And this, in 1438, after the short
space of two years of suspense in the firm.</p>

<p>Father Melchoir, his spiritual adviser, noticed the
change.</p>

<p>“My son,” said he, “something troubles thee;
confide the matter to me; perhaps I can help thee.”</p>

<p>“I am indeed in trouble,” replied he, glad of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
confidant, for the secret and the doubt of success
together wore on him. “I fear that I shall be
ruined as to worldly prospects.”</p>

<p>“I trust not: how is it, my son? From what
source is the danger?”</p>

<p>“Alas, Father, gladly would I tell thee, but I
have bound myself with an oath not to reveal the
secret.”</p>

<p>“But, my son, the Church does not recognize
oaths in such a case. They are null and void for
all purposes whatsoever, and thou art free to tell
me all thy heart at the confessional: it is even thy
solemn duty to do so.”</p>

<p>Dritzhn was only too easily persuaded, and, despite
his sacred oath, told Father Melchoir of his
connection with the firm.</p>

<p>“I have given hundreds of florins,” said he, “to
bring out a hidden art of writing, with the hope
long ere this of selling books and getting profits
from my money. A few have been sold, but I have
received no dividend. Besides, I have earned but
little by my trade for these two long years; my
time has been thrown away, and I am poorer than
ever.”</p>

<p>“A very sad case!” said Father Melchoir, compassionately.</p>

<p>“This load is too heavy for me to bear,” lamented
Dritzhn; “it will kill me! To think of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
throwing away hundreds of florins on a doubtful art,
without in return getting back a single obolus!<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
What can I do?”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The very expression of Dritzhn at confessional.</p></div>

<p>“Get free from this secret league as soon as possible,
and resume thy trade.”</p>

<p>“I wish it could be done, Father, but I fear it
cannot. If I leave the firm, I shall lose all chance
of getting back the money I have lent them. I am
in doubt what to do.”</p>

<p>“Leave it by all means!” cried Father Melchoir;
“be sure no good will come of their arts.”</p>

<p>“I will see what I can do,” said Dritzhn, and he
rose to go. As he entered the shop, he found Gutenberg,
Hielman, and Riffe busy setting new type
for another work. It was a dictionary, called a
“Catholicon.” They were all eager in their toil,
and spoke warmly of the ready sale it would find,
and the money it would bring in. Dritzhn, a little
encouraged, resumed his work with them, nor did
he breathe a word of his plan of leaving. It was
too great a step to take hastily, although he wished
himself safely out of the partnership.</p>

<p>There was so much repairing of type to do, and
so many unlooked-for hinderances, that the book
was delayed, and 1439 came round before it was
finished, although Gutenberg was meanwhile steadily
improving his art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
At this point of time, the autumn of 1439, just
when they were about realizing their hopes in issuing
the “Catholicon,” an event occurred which
threw everything into confusion. This was the
sudden death of Andreas Dritzhn. If ever the
adversary hindered an enterprise, it was the art
of printing; he had doubtless reasons of his own
for multiplying obstacles.</p>

<p>Accordingly the death of Andreas was the pretext;
and directly George and Nicholas, brothers of
the deceased, two sturdy jogging Germans, who
never harmed a fly, on arriving home from Andreas’s
funeral, demanded of Gutenberg, Hielman,
and Riffe to be admitted to the partnership!</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Gutenberg; “if we can find
it in the contract, it shall be done.” Then, producing
the document, he <span class="locked">read:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Art. 2.</span> If any one of the partners shall die
during the copartnership, the survivors shall pay to
his heirs the sum of one hundred florins, in consideration
of which the effects shall become the property
of the surviving partners.”</p>

<p>“Nay, gentlemen, you cannot become partners,
but we will pay you what is due as the heirs of Andreas
Dritzhn.” Then, looking over the accounts of
the firm, he added, “Your brother is indebted to us
in the sum of eighty-five florins; we will pay you
the remaining fifteen, which will balance accounts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
George and Nicholas rejected the offer with disdain,
and, hastening away, conferred with each other
as to what they should do. Two strong principles
were at work in their hearts,&mdash;avarice and curiosity.
From some few hints which Andreas had
dropped while living, George and Nicholas were as
much excited about the hidden arts of Gutenberg
as we covetous moderns are with a chance at a rich
vein in a gold mine; and they determined to try a
suit at law, and if possible become members of the
secret league.</p>

<p>This was in the autumn, and was peculiarly
grievous to the inventor. The lawsuit consumed
his time, thwarted his plans, and there was great
danger that the secrets of his art would become public.
The protection of the patent offices was then
unknown. No inventor could put in a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">caveat</i> to
hinder the encroachments of trespassers. The lawsuit
had bruited abroad that Gutenberg &amp; Co. had
a secret art, which, like the philosopher’s stone,
turned everything into gold; and curiosity, on tip-toe,
used every device to get a peep at the wonder.
Gutenberg’s work was at an end. It took all his
time to attend the courts, and watch his shop, that
no one might steal his art. It required double diligence
to do the last, as the shop was in Andreas’s
house. Despite his cautions to Hielman and Riffe,
one day, in his absence, George and Nicholas managed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
to take from the shop a part of the printing
apparatus. Gutenberg then gave orders to his servants
to convey secretly to his house a printing-press
and a quantity of letters cut in wood. The
theft was a source of great anxiety to him, as he
feared that the secret was out. The careful thieves,
however, safely hid their booty, and lisped not a
word.</p>

<p>At length it became evident to Gutenberg&mdash;such
was the pitch to which curiosity had risen&mdash;that
every vestige of the noble art must be destroyed.
It was not safe even to hide it in his own
house.</p>

<p>“Take the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i> from the forms,” said he to his
associates, “and break them up in my sight, that
none of them may remain perfect.”</p>

<p>“What, all our labor?” cried Hielman; “here
we’ve been at work these three years!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” replied Gutenberg; “break them
up, or some one will steal our art, and we shall be
ruined!” and with that they set to work with their
hammers and mallets, and the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i> was soon demolished.
His precious type lay in the dust, and
still the lawsuit was lacerating his sensitive mind.</p>

<p>The following curious testimony was given during
this <span class="locked">trial:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Anna, the wife of John Schultheiss, an engraver
on wood, deposed, that on one occasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Nicholas Beildeck came to her house to Nicholas
Dritzhn, her relation, and said to him, ‘My Nicholas
Dritzhn, Andreas Dritzhn, of happy memory, has
placed four pages (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i>) in a press, which Gutenberg
has desired that you will take away and separate,
that no man may know what they are, for he
is unwilling that any one should see them.’</p>

<p>“Also John Schultheiss says that Laurence Beildeck
[Gutenberg’s servant] sometime came to his
house to Nicholas Dritzhn, when Andreas Dritzhn
his brother was dead, and that the said Laurence
Beildeck thus spoke to said Nicholas Dritzhn: ‘Andreas
Dritzhn, of happy memory, has placed four
pages on a press, which John Gutenberg desires
you to take therefrom, and break them from one
another, so that no man may see what they are.’</p>

<p>“Also Conrad Sachspach deposed that sometime
Andrew Hielman came to him upon the Street of
Merchants, and said, ‘My Conrad, as Andreas
Dritzhn is dead, and you made that press and know
all about the matter, go hence and take the pieces
from the press, and lay them separate from one another,
so that no one may know what it is.’</p>

<p>“Laurence Beildeck says that he was sent by
John Gutenberg to Nicholas Dritzhn, after the
death of Andreas his brother, to say to him that
he should show to no one the press that he had,
and that he should see to it. He added that Gutenberg<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
had moreover commanded him that he
should go suddenly to the presses, and open that
press [frame] which was furnished with two <em>screws</em>
or spindles (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cochleis</i>) that the pages should fall into
pieces, and place those pieces within or upon the
press, so that no one should see the matter, or understand
what it was.</p>

<p>“The same witness also said that he knew well
that Gutenberg, a little before the Feast of the Nativity
[Christmas], had sent his servant to take
away all forms, which were broken up in his sight,
that none of them might be found perfect. Moreover,
after the death of Andreas, the witness was
not ignorant that many were desirous of seeing the
presses, and that Gutenberg had commanded that
some one should be sent who might hinder any one
from seeing the presses, and that his servants were
sent to break them up.</p>

<p>“Also John Dunnius, goldsmith, said that three
years or thereabouts previous, he had received from
Gutenberg about three hundred florins for materials
relating to printing.”</p>

<p>All this affected the Strasbourgers, both priests
and people, very differently from what it does ourselves.
We prize it as a legal document, showing
the existence of separate types, and also two
presses, one of them made by Conrad Sachspach
and the other by John Dunnius, to whom the firm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
paid three hundred florins for press-work done in
December, 1436. These presses served very different
purposes, as Gutenberg commanded his servant
to “open that press which was furnished with two
<em>screws</em> or spindles.” Plainly one was the “chase”
for type, and the other the upright frame with a
screw, which moved down the platen to impress
the paper placed upon the type. We learn also
that the art was a secret at the time when Laurentius
Costar lay at the point of death, and those
mistake who give him the honor of inventing printing.</p>

<p>We can picture to ourselves the excitement
which prevailed, when a man of Gutenberg’s firm
character was led to make such utter destruction
of his property after the disclosures of the lawsuit.
He may have feared that a lawless mob would invade
his shop, and scatter the proofs of his invention,
and that some person of ingenuity would get a
clew to the art, and rob him of his sacred rights.
What hours, days and nights of solicitude he suffered!
Those only, who in a good cause have
met the scoffs and jeers of the rabble excited by
unscrupulous leaders, can well imagine the inventor’s
emotions.</p>

<p>Happily, Anna was equal to the emergency, and
became a very heroine. She had no idea of being
crushed, although for a little while she had given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
way to despondency, and her strong-hearted courage
inspired her husband. His home was a little
paradise of peace, the resort of flowers and birds
and all beautiful things which she instinctively
gathered around her. God’s gracious smile rested
upon it, and in this sanctuary Gutenberg’s wounded
spirit was soothed; here he gained strength, and
girded on his armor anew for the battle of life.
The fiercer the strife without, the more blessed the
peace within this retreat.</p>

<p>The lawsuit dragged its slow length on until December
12th of that year, when the magistrates gave
judgment relieving Gutenberg from “the unjust
demand of George and Nicholas Dritzhn, upon the
payment of the sum of fifteen florins, being the
difference of the sum of one hundred florins due to
Gutenberg by Andrew on the original contract.”</p>

<p>This was just what Gutenberg had proposed at
first; and his adversaries had their trouble for their
pains, without, perhaps, the consolation of knowing
how much they had annoyed him. The lawsuit was
over, but it had exposed the state of Gutenberg’s
affairs, and people were curious to learn more.
Rumor was busy with her thousand tongues. “He
is not willing that any one should see!” “Something
wrong!” and in the spirit of the superstition
of the times, many cried out, “Mystery! Witchcraft!”
The whole community was in a ferment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Time passed, and a little before the Feast of the
Nativity, so faithfully had Gutenberg’s orders as to
the destruction of the press and type been executed,
that nothing remained of the wonderful art,
which since the death of Dritzhn, had so much disturbed
the good city of Strasbourg.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> country of the Rhine was visited by a wintry
tempest from the North Sea. Benighted,
Gutenberg, wrapped in his monk’s cloak, little
heeded the roaring winds and cutting blasts, as, after
destroying the work of years, he bade adieu to
Dritzhn’s shop, and hurried homeward. The storm
of life, the contest with his fellow-men, was more
pitiless to him than the fierce raging of the elements.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when Anna, placing a light in
the window, stirred the fire, and sat down to await
his coming. The supper table was invitingly spread,
and the covered dish of food placed by the fire to
keep warm.</p>

<p>“Why does he not come? May God preserve
him from unreasonable men;” and she caught up
her work to while away the time. An hour passed,
seeming to Anna much longer, when a cricket,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
warmed into consciousness by the genial heat,
hopped out of his covert, coated with dust, and
blithely sang.</p>

<p>“A good omen!” mused Anna; and shortly after,
true enough, there was a stamping on the step,
and a shaking of garments; and, springing to the
door, she welcomed her husband.</p>

<p>“O, it is yourself! come at last. But you look
like a huge white bear!” And she gayly laughed
as she drew him in, and brushed off the snow.
“I was in fear lest some evil had overtaken you,
until our dear little cricket piped on the hearth, as
if to assure me that you were almost here.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Gutenberg, throwing off his cloak,
and hanging it on its peg in the corner, “and my
Anna and my home welcome me as cheerily as
ever.”</p>

<p>“We at least ought to comfort thee when the
world without weareth such dark frowns.”</p>

<p>“Ave, aye, there is need of comfort. But I divine
that some one has been here in my absence, and
given thee cause of anxiety.”</p>

<p>“O, nothing worth minding,” returned the little
wife. “Let us sup, and speak of the bright side of
life.”</p>

<p>“I am puzzled to find it; but thou canst point
it out doubtless.”</p>

<p>“Shall we forget,” said Anna, “the mercy and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the blessing that we are spared to each other, and
that no lawless mob has invaded our peace?”</p>

<p>“Aye, we do well to remember that it might be
worse with us,” was the reply; and having reverently
said grace, for a time supper was discussed in
silence, for Anna’s last question had awakened
grave thoughts. Suddenly the cricket broke out
anew with his shrill note.</p>

<p>“What does the creature mean?” asked Gutenberg.
“Does he dream that it is summer?”</p>

<p>“Bethink thee; he is the insect prophet of hope.
He is saying, ‘Bright days are coming, never
fear!’”</p>

<p>“I trust the hearth minstrel is right; he will at
least be useful in making me sleep well; his song
sounds like a lullaby! But now that supper is over,
what of thy visitor?”</p>

<p>“It was John Schultheiss’ wife,” replied Anna.</p>

<p>“That dark-browed woman! Why came she?”</p>

<p>“To comfort me with evil tidings; to tell me
that it had been clearly proved in court that thy
hidden art was no better than witchcraft, but that
such was the inefficiency of the magistrates that
they gave decision in thy favor. Some believe
that thou art in league with the devil, and can
enchant them or spoil their goods.”</p>

<p>“What superstition!” exclaimed Gutenberg;
“this comes of ignorance, and the scarcity of
books!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
“I did not reason with her, or make reply, and
she soon left; and soon after, Simon, the Barefoot
Friar, appeared. His religion, as you know, consists
in clothing himself in rags, begging from house to
house, and paying for his welcome in prayers and
benedictions. As I opened the door in answer to
his loud knocking, he cried out, ‘God save the
house!’ then, as he came in, added, ‘God save
the house, and all that’s in it! God save it to the
north!’ and he made the sign of the cross in every
direction towards which he turned. ‘God save it
to the south! + to the east! + and to the west! + Save
it upwards!’ turning his eyes heavenward,
and crossing himself, ‘and save it downwards! + Save
it backwards! + and save it forwards! + Save
it right! + and save it left! + Save it by night! + and
save it by day! + Save it here! + and save it
there! + Save it this way! + and save it that
way! + Save it eating! + + + and save it drinking!
+ + + + + + + + Oxis Doxis Glorioxis, Amen.’”</p>

<p>Gutenberg joined Anna in a merry laugh at this
farce, as she went on rehearsing the idle priest’s
performance.</p>

<p>“‘And how are you, gracious lady, now that I
have blessed the place in the name of Saint Peter
and all the Apostles and the nine patriarchs? Isn’t
a merry Christmas coming to you? And isn’t there
plenty of good cheer in the house?’ So I made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
him welcome, giving him a seat by the fire, and a
dish of the best food the house afforded.</p>

<p>“‘You don’t say that you’re prospering,’ said he,
as I helped him to the second supply; for he ate
like some great animal.</p>

<p>“‘We are in trouble!’ I answered.</p>

<p>“‘I know it!’ he exclaimed, with a laugh,
munching a mouthful and clapping his hands. ‘I
had it revealed to me! I know all about it; and
I know the prayer for it. Oxis Doxis! + + + If
you’d only sent to me in the first of it, I could
have kept your trouble back, and I can now be a
hindering cause to it, and get you safely through,
for I know the prayer for it; Oxis Doxis! + and
I’ll go at it directly when I get refreshed.’”</p>

<p>“His own comfort first!” said Gutenberg, laughing.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Anna, “and isn’t he a good specimen
of that class of priests, who are really only
beggars? All so wise in their own opinion, and so
ready to instruct every one they meet. How different
from the devout and learned priests who
minister the services of our holy church!”</p>

<p>“But how didst thou get rid of him?”</p>

<p>“After he had eaten like a glutton, he was ready
to give me religious instruction. ‘Do you know,
gracious lady,’ said he, devoutly crossing himself,
‘that you are the very likeness of the Blessed Virgin?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
I know it, for she communicates with me
from heaven.’</p>

<p>“‘Does she speak to you, Simon?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘The Blessed Virgin herself does so, and no one
else,’ he answered. ‘And now let me tell thee,
daughter, what she said to me only last night. I
was just composing myself to sleep, after opening
my window a little ways to let her in,&mdash;for she is in
the habit of appearing to me,&mdash;when a silvery cloud
came floating through the air, and the Blessed
Lady alighted, came in, and took her seat upon my
bed. I made haste to say my “Ave Maria,” she
the while sweetly smiling; and after I had said
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ora pro nobis</i> exactly nine hundred and ninety-nine
times, our holy Queen of Heaven and Mother of
God opened her ruby lips, showed me her pearly
teeth, and revealed to me that the Barefoot Friars
are the dearest to her of all the orders of monks;
and she showed me an easy way to get to heaven,
making me a solemn promise that whoever dies
with a Barefoot Friar’s cloak on, shall assuredly go
to heaven.’”</p>

<p>“The impostor!” exclaimed Gutenberg. “Does
he teach such doctrines as these? Of what avail
could his cloak be in such a matter? I do not
wonder that John Wickliffe was stirred up to denounce
such men almost a century ago!”</p>

<p>“When I remember,” said Anna, “that Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
II. found out one hundred murders committed by
priests, I am afraid to refuse the beggar friars when
they ask for food. I know not what they might do
when angry. They would at least curse me, and
call down the judgments of Heaven.”</p>

<p>“Which would harm thee as little as it did
Wickliffe,” said Gutenberg. “It is related of him
that when he was very sick, the friars burst into
his room with abusive language and curses, prophesying
his death and torment, which so roused him
that he sprang from his bed and drove them out,
saying, ‘I shall not die, but live to declare the evil
deeds of you friars.’”</p>

<p>“Would there were more like him!” said Anna.</p>

<p>“We have some pious priests,” replied Gutenberg,
“but others are corrupt and time-serving.
Occasionally one studies the Bible, and is guided
by its precepts; but there are so few copies of the
sacred Word, that all cannot have it if they would.
If its laws were more generally known, there would
be a reformation in the lives of many of these men.
I had my heart on multiplying copies of this Book
of books, but alas! my plans have been frustrated!”
and the tears dimmed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Never fear, thou wilt yet be prospered,” returned
Anna, soothingly. “Wickliffe did not fail in
what he attempted, neither wilt thou fail of accomplishing
something worthy of thy aims and efforts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
“But my work is done in Strasbourg. I cannot
stem this tide of prejudice and jealousy.”</p>

<p>“Strasbourg is not all the world,” rejoined Anna.
“We can remove where people and priests are
not against thee.”</p>

<p>“But unless God interposes,” said Gutenberg,
“I have no hope that I shall ever return to my
art.”</p>

<p>At the close of the lawsuit, Gutenberg found
himself overwhelmed with debt. His presses, type,
and all his printing materials were destroyed. He
was a poor man, and must start anew in the world.
And such was the popular prejudice against his beloved
art, that he saw it was useless to attempt it
again. Besides, Riffe and Hielman were now
wholly averse to the business; they urged that it
had never been profitable, and that defeat and disaster
had attended its prosecution. It only remained
for them to resume the lapidary trade in
the little shop of Gutenberg’s cottage. This served
a good purpose in allaying the excitement which
had been stirred up by the revelations of the lawsuit.
And the inventor was thankful that he had
something positive to fall back upon in the hour of
his extremity, and often contrasted his condition
with what it would have been otherwise.</p>

<p>With the weight of a bitter disappointment resting
upon him, he wrought successfully at his trade,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
despite the efforts of certain evil disposed persons,
who sought to crush him in the hour of his defeat.
Now he had little intercourse with his fellow-citizens
and the monks of the Cathedral, save in the way
of business. It was the time of his reverses, and
he had fewer friends than formerly.</p>

<p>By constant application he managed to get a
comfortable support and pay his most pressing liabilities;
for the rest he suppressed his noble tastes.
It was vain to stem the tide of poverty, ill-will, and
evil surmisings which would infallibly meet him,
had he the means even to attempt the prosecution
of his favorite aims. Yet in his dreams he was
often cutting type and working his press as of old.
How he sighed to find them only dreams!</p>

<p>Thus, with alternations of hopes and fears, the
latter predominating, passed the period till the close
of 1441, at which time he was glad to be released
from all connection with Riffe and Hielman. There
was little congeniality to make their daily intercourse
agreeable, and no one of the firm proposed
another term of contract.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> dissolution of the firm was in some respects
a benefit to the lapidary. He had time for
quiet thought, and, as in years gone by, his shop was
his sanctum. Feeling at ease, his work progressed
rapidly, and his day’s task was often accomplished
ere the sun declined, when instinctively his hand
followed the bent of his mind, and engaged in cutting
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i>. He said nothing of this to Anna, until,
by accumulations of spare hours’ work, he had made
a fount of type. He then surprised her by showing
his treasures.</p>

<p>“That is so much like thee, John!” she exclaimed.
“I do believe thou wilt yet even receive
the reward of thy perseverance; but thou canst not
attempt great things now, not having the means of
making a press, and with no one to assist thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
“I have made this type in the leisure after my
daily work,” was the reply; “I can, moreover, devote
a portion of my energies to preparing apparatus
for imprinting; it will, however, avail me little in
this place. Nevertheless, I shall work on, hoping
that it will at some time turn to account.”</p>

<p>Gutenberg’s evenings were henceforth occupied
in constructing a frame to inclose the type, and a
printing-press; but it was some two years from the
time of the disbanding of the firm before he was
ready to print. He then issued an alphabetical
table, called the “Absies.” This was a one page
book, and had besides the alphabet, an Address to
the Virgin Mary, and the Lord’s Prayer. He had
designed it for the use of the pupils in the Cathedral
school, but it was some time before he had courage
to attempt introducing it.</p>

<p>A little incident decided him. It happened one
morning that Peter Schoeffer, a scholar who had
assisted in selling the block books, and now famed
for his skill in penmanship, came into the shop.
He had at one period called often, and a friendship
had sprung up between himself and the inventor.
The latter, sure of his sympathy, showed
him a copy of the “Absies.” Schoeffer was highly
pleased, and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“According to my thinking, this is what we need
in our school. The letters are regular and plain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and it would save great labor in copying.” He then
volunteered to bring the work to the notice of his
teacher; and after inquiry and examination the
school was furnished with the “Absies.”</p>

<p>Time passed, Gutenberg leading much the same
life,&mdash;mostly engaged in the lapidary business, and
printing a small page occasionally; in this last
work having little patronage. It was, indeed, useless
to attempt printing at Strasbourg; the old
prejudice reviving as soon as it was known that he
had made any new issues. He resolved, therefore,
to abandon the place forever. But where should
he go? As was natural, he decided to return to
Mentz, the home of his childhood and youth. In
this decision Anna fully concurred, sensible that
her husband could never succeed in the place of
his defeat.</p>

<p>Gutenberg was deeply moved on approaching his
native city, Mentz. He had left it in the buoyancy
of youth, a chevalier; less than a score of earnest,
struggling, eventful years pass, and he returns an
artisan. Humiliation, indigence, and glory had
wrestled in his destiny. The lawsuit had spread
his fame through Germany; but poor, ruined, condemned,
he comes back with aching heart and disappointed
hopes to reconstruct, if possible, his fallen
fortunes. His parents were no more; and hesitatingly
he drew near the old home, a stately ancestral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
dwelling. How would his brother receive him and
his in the day of his adversity? Would he find him
estranged by the cruel slanders of the Strasbourg
busybodies? He well knew that he should miss
the loving ministrations of his sister Hebele, as,
soon after his departure, she had joined the St.
Claire Convent; and now he realized as never before,
her living burial. Alas! she seemed dead to
her friends. Forebodingly he crossed the threshold
of his fathers; but Friele, true brother that he was,
met him joyfully, bidding him welcome again and
again. This sympathy was most grateful to the
wanderer in his reverses; still he was only half-satisfied,
he so much longed for help in his beloved
art; but how could he speak of it, and perchance
break the spell of their happy meeting? Friele
had, however, learned many passages of his late
history from Gutenberg’s occasional letters to his
mother, and eagerly questioned him for farther
particulars. This led the inventor to dwell on his
struggles to bring out an art which would multiply
books, and lessen the labor of making them. Friele
listened intently, yet was doubtful of new things.
He promised, however, to aid him in some feasible
way. This might be the work of time, and meanwhile
he begged him to be hopeful and happy, expressing
his conviction that all would yet turn out
for the best. This loving reception was balm to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
the wounded spirit of the inventor; and feeling that
he could safely confide in his brother, he showed
him some of the works he had printed, and the
printing materials which he had brought with him,
at the same time acknowledging more fully his
strong wish of commencing the business in Mentz.</p>

<p>Friele was increasingly interested, and hoped to
be able to assist him; meanwhile Gutenberg decided
to rent a small cottage, and pursue his business
of the lapidary; occupying himself as he might
be able, in fitting up his printing apparatus.</p>

<p>One day, some time after, as he was passing the
Church of St. Christopher, he met his brother
Friele in earnest discourse with a stranger, whom
he introduced as John Faust, saying to Gutenberg,
<span class="locked">smilingly,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We were just speaking of thee, brother
John!”</p>

<p>“I am most happy to meet thee!” said Faust,
cordially. “I should know you from your resemblance
to your father. I am well-acquainted with
your cousins and all your kindred; I esteem them
highly, and heartily welcome back a former townsman,&mdash;a
member of one of our patrician families.”</p>

<p>Friele pleasantly bowed and passed on, as Faust
<span class="locked">continued:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Your brother has given me some account of
your efforts in the arts; and I am desirous of learning
more respecting them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
The heart of Gutenberg was touched by the genuine
interest in himself and his endeavors, manifested
by the rich goldsmith; and the two new
friends were soon walking the streets absorbed in
conversation.</p>

<p>“I have devised a most important invention,”
said Gutenberg, “and it remains hidden like a
buried seed till the rain and sunshine bring it up to
light and fruitage. Would that I had my hoarded
patrimony, that I might render my discovery available!
But such is the necessity of keeping the details
of my processes, that I have not ventured to
apply for money to prosecute the art.”</p>

<p>“If I had a full understanding of what it is, I
might perhaps assist thee,” returned the banker.</p>

<p>“It concerns book-making,” explained Gutenberg,
for Faust was fast winning his confidence.
“You are aware that the great work of the monasteries
in Germany, as elsewhere, is copying
books, and that they receive vast sums for their
works. My new process doth entirely supercede
their toil, and fashioneth books without the labor
of copying.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” ejaculated Faust.</p>

<p>“But I can demonstrate it!”</p>

<p>“Good, if thou canst prove it beyond all question.
But what money is needed to carry out thy
wonderful discovery?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
“Some two or three thousand florins,” answered
Gutenberg.</p>

<p>“If I were convinced,” returned the other,
“that it would pay better than goldsmithing,&mdash;but
I must see specimens of thy work, before committing
myself to the enterprise.”</p>

<p>“And I will with pleasure show them you, provided
you will pledge yourself that, if convinced,
you will invest in the undertaking. Meanwhile
rest assured that it will yet pay richly. Why,
consider what moneys the monks receive; and
my books will be more in demand, since they are
better executed.”</p>

<p>“As to books,” remarked the goldsmith, “according
to my thinking there are enough in the
world already. They serve little purpose save to
turn active men into mopers. Nevertheless, as people
will have them, there can be no harm that we
should make a profit by furnishing them. They
may as well have books as jewelry and mirrors,
which gratify their vanity.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” replied the inventor, smiling;
“and when you come to know my art, you cannot
fail to admire it.”</p>

<p>“Art!” exclaimed Faust jocosely, “hath it
aught to do with the black art? I could not abide
that. Much as I value money, I would not league
myself with the Evil One.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
“By no means,” said Gutenberg, a mirthful expression
breaking over his care-worn face, “and
you have no greater abhorrence of such wickedness
than myself.” Then seriously, “I believe in using
the wisdom that God giveth. As saith St. James,
‘If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who
giveth unto all men liberally, and upbraideth not.’”</p>

<p>“But what if thou art deceived in thy business
calculations? What then will become of my
money?” asked Faust.</p>

<p>“There can be no mistake,” was the answer.
“I have put the discovery to practical use; I
have made books by it, and there can be no illusion.
This I will demonstrate before we sign a
contract. If it were not a great discovery, and
most beneficent and far-reaching in its results, I
would not be thus earnest to bring it out. But to
delay is risking too much; in case of my death,
it would perish with me.”</p>

<p>“If I can be convinced that it is a certainty,”
returned Faust, “I will furnish capital; but I cannot
abide a doubt. As I said, if I am satisfied, we
will draw up and sign an agreement; you, on your
part, to teach me the secrets of the art; I, on my
part, to provide money; and the profits to be shared
equally.”</p>

<p>He then agreed to come and spend the ensuing
day at Gutenberg’s house, examining specimens of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
his work and investigating the practicability of his
invention.</p>

<p>It was noon the next day when Gutenberg took
Faust home with him, to the dismay of Anna, who,
since her preoccupied husband had forgotten the
marketing, had only the prospect of a dinner of
herbs for her guest. At length, in her anxiety, she
heard the sound of a fisherman’s horn; and, sallying
out into the street, she purchased a great treasure,&mdash;a
fish. In due time the simple repast was
ready; and when they were seated at the table,
Faust, reverting to the subject of their previous
conference, <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Your invention has something to do with engraving
on wood. How can that be less laborious than copying?”</p>

<p>“It is precisely to draw your attention to that
point that I spoke of it,” replied Gutenberg. “With
that alone we could not even imprint a large work
in a life-time. But if, instead of engraving a whole
page on a solid block, we use a small movable
block for engraving each letter, you see that we
can then use the same letters any number of times,
and so lessen our labors beyond all calculation.
This is the first great step of my invention. Does
it not seem simple? Why did no one think of it
before?”</p>

<p>He then described the process by which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
reached his various improvements, dwelling especially
on his invention of the press.</p>

<p>“You must have a world of perseverance!” observed
Faust, admiringly.</p>

<p>“When one gets on the track of a great idea,”
said Gutenberg, a handsome glow tinging his
cheeks, “it is hard to give it up.”</p>

<p>“But you are an artist in gems,” interrupted
Faust. “Who executed the work in wood for
you?”</p>

<p>“Conrad Sachspach, at Strasbourg, made the
frame, following my directions. But I must show
you some of my books;” and, rising, he produced
a number, and among them the “Speculum,” which
was made partly from blocks and partly from movable
type.</p>

<p>“Are these really specimens of books, Master
Gutenberg?” asked Faust with surprise. “Wonderful!
wonderful! thou hast wisely devised a
most useful art, that will shortly bring thee both
riches and renown!”</p>

<p>“And thou hast the faculty to quickly comprehend
my art,” replied Gutenberg with a beaming
face.</p>

<p>“That is true,” added Anna, “and it is so
blessed to be appreciated. But while you warm
over your theme, dinner gets cold!” and a laugh
went round the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
“This is a worthy deed of thine, madam,” replied
Faust, “preparing a good dinner, and making
us laugh. Physicians would commend thee.”</p>

<p>“What would they say to my husband? wouldn’t
they counsel him to descend from the clouds and eat
like other people?”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it, madam, since ideas, however
original, have not the nourishing elements of food.
You have been tried by your husband’s application
to his one idea?”</p>

<p>“At times,” replied Anna, “I have failed to see
the service of it.” Faust laughed heartily, <span class="locked">adding,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Time enough for the utility, madam. The invention
must go through a process to become available;
it must creep before it can walk. Have patience,
madam!”</p>

<p>“I try to have a great store,” she playfully said,
“but he is so taken up with his projects that I can
scarcely ever get a word from him. When he
leaves his work-shop for the day, and draws his
chair to the fire, one would think he might have
the grace to be sociable; but there he sits and pokes
the fire, reads the fire, studies the fire, half the
night, and I would like to know what is the necessity
of so much meditation?”</p>

<p>“Ah, madam,” returned Faust, “it is the common
experience of inventors to meet many adversities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
in the outset. You have reason to be proud of
your husband. As I understand it, he has made a
great discovery,&mdash;the beginning of something of
vast importance.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to Gutenberg, he added, “I am
ready to advance thy invention. But how shall we
move? Secrecy is indispensable. We must live
in the same house in which we work,&mdash;we must
consult much together. Where is there a suitable
building?”</p>

<p>“I had thought of the Zum Jungen,” said Gutenberg.</p>

<p>“The very place. It is almost a palace in size,
and will afford ample room; is in the city, and yet
retired from its bustle. It is now vacant, and I will
go and engage it at once. This evening let us draw
up a written contract, or articles of agreement, and
I will advance the needed funds. When can you
remove?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, can we not, Anna?”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed she, “can we get ready so
soon? We are scarcely settled yet.”</p>

<p>“The easier to remove,” replied Gutenberg; adding,
“moreover, the Zum Jungen is a very beautiful
place, and reminds me of the old castle Thür,
where I first met my Anna!”</p>

<p>“Let us go at once,” immediately returned
the wife; “it must be delightful. Why cannot De<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Becktoff de Hanau come and help us remove?”
alluding to an old servant and valet of the Gutenberg
family, who, like others of their servants, had
been allowed to hire himself out, since he could not
be maintained.</p>

<p>“A good thought, wife; he shall take charge of
our goods, and we shall avoid some of the fatigue
of a second removal. I will bring him hither;”
and Faust having taken leave, Gutenberg hastened
to find the old valet.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Zum Jungen, that famous old house on the
Rhine, was engaged; the articles of agreement
duly drawn up and signed. Faust advanced 2,020
florins, taking a mortgage of Gutenberg’s printing
materials as security; and the firm, having removed
their families to the building, commenced operations
in the printing rooms. Hanau, the valet of the
elder Gutenberg, was especially serviceable in the
removal, and was soon installed as a faithful helper
in the office.</p>

<p>“What think you of this?” said Gutenberg to
Anna one morning, soon after the settlement in
their new quarters, as they stood on the balcony
that overlooked the river.</p>

<p>“O, it is so beautiful!” she replied. “Never
will I tire of this scenery. There; do you see those
swallows sitting so still upon their nests under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the roofs? Now one flies off zigzag to the ground,
after a worm; now she bears it back, perches upon
her nest, and chippers with her little ones as they
eat their breakfast. Hear them chatter! Then
how fragrant the flowers! How pretty the hills,
clad in vineyards! I feel at home already, and I
mean to be happy, and let no foreboding trouble me.
I do not yet ride in a coach, and dine like a queen,
but my home is in a palace. How good it was in
Faust to advance money! What a difference it
makes in our circumstances!”</p>

<p>“Besides, how it affects my art!” returned Gutenberg.
“How could I prosper without it? And,
Anna, we do well to remember that there has been
providential interposition in our affairs. We must
acknowledge it if we would be directed. Think of
the long trial we have had, and of our deliverer.”</p>

<p>“It does seem like a miracle. But how canst
thou ever make new types and presses like those
which were destroyed at Strasbourg?”</p>

<p>“Trust me I shall not be long of doing that,”
answered Gutenberg. “I am encouraged. The
prospect was dark until my arrangement with
Faust; but we shall do well enough, now that abundant
means are provided.”</p>

<p>At first the firm was occupied with some of the
block books which had been issued at Strasbourg.
Among these were the “Absies,” or alphabetical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
tables, the “Doctrinale,” and a manual of grammar,
or “Donatus.”</p>

<p>The work did indeed go prosperously forward.
Gutenberg, Faust, Hanau, and Martin Duttlinger,&mdash;the
last named a Cathedral scholar who had assisted
in printing at Dritzhn’s shop,&mdash;were occupied
from early in the morning till late at night in cutting
type and setting it up. Faust had also occasionally
some of his workmen&mdash;a Hamburgher
among them&mdash;in the printing hall. They wrought
in two well-lighted, convenient rooms in the second
story,&mdash;so surrounded by other rooms as not to be
accessible to strangers,&mdash;which apartments they
kept constantly locked.</p>

<p>Step by step, the company went through in a few
months what caused Gutenberg years of experimenting,
as we in a few hours can read a book
which cost the author the study of a life. Not
that they really mastered everything as did their
teacher. That which he himself elaborated, was
indeed a part of his mind, his inventions being
his thoughts embodied. Hence the propriety of
giving him so prominent a place in this volume.
The art cannot be fittingly portrayed without
sketching its originator. Like soul and body, they
belong together; it is impossible to picture one
without the other.</p>

<p>To describe the process by which Gutenberg<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
taught his art, would be to repeat the progress of
the Strasbourg firm, save that the Mentz printers
were more hopeful, earnest, and intelligent, and did
not so easily yield to obstacles; and also the difference
that they were immediately advanced to
movable type.</p>

<p>“We are making fine headway,” said Faust to
Gutenberg, when the works referred to had been
printed.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we sadly need a designer for our engravings.
How I miss my Andreas Dritzhn, of
happy memory, who did excellent service in this
line at Strasbourg.”</p>

<p>“Cannot some one be found to fill his place?”</p>

<p>“I know of only one man that would do,” replied
Gutenberg, “and that is young Peter Schoeffer, a
teacher of penmanship, now residing in Paris. I
must send him word to join us.”</p>

<p>As the printing went on, Gutenberg encountered
the old difficulty of the softening of the type, and,
on being questioned by Faust respecting it, set his
ingenious mind to work to remedy it.</p>

<p>Turning to a drawer of odds and ends, and taking
out some bits of metal, he said, “Suppose we
make our type of lead!” Faust took up a strip,
and, commencing a rude letter on the end of it, said,
“This will do, assuredly. It is hard, and yet we
can cut it, and it will not become soft, as does wood,
by absorbing ink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
“We can at least test it,” said Gutenberg. “If
it should not prove to be just what we need, it may
suggest something useful. My progress has been
made by a series of experiments; and because we
fail once, is no reason for discouragement. We
have only to try until we succeed.”</p>

<p>Faust’s letter gave him much satisfaction. “We
have discovered the right thing for our type!” said
he, after making an impression with it. He then
strode up and down the room, now looking at this
form, now that, then stopping to dab the leather
ink-balls on the type, then taking up a manuscript,
and generally making himself at home in the
printing-office. Since he had become a partner
and patron, his manner had grown pompous and
somewhat lordly. Although a mere novice in the
new art, he was fully sensible of the honor he conferred
on the firm in associating himself with it,
and very naturally assumed a general oversight.
The inventor saw the infirmities of his friend, but
forebore remark. He was both discerning and
patient.</p>

<p>One afternoon, some weeks later, as a shower
was rising, Anna sat by her window, alternately sewing
and watching the clouds as they gathered in
dark columns and overspread the sky. The brown
sparrows that frequented the roof of the Zum Jungen,
chattered as the large drops fell, perching upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the tiles and laughing at the rain. Just then who
should be coming up the street but Gutenberg and
Peter Schoeffer, in earnest discourse, seeming to
heed the weather as little as did the birds. Gutenberg
had opened his heart to Schoeffer as to an old
friend; he felt confidence in doing so, for Schoeffer
had proved himself estimable and trusty when in
his employ at Strasbourg. As they came nearer
and entered the house, Anna heard Gutenberg say,
“Canst thou tell me, Master Schoeffer, now that
we are on my art, what is the most notable and
important book in the world?”</p>

<p>“I do not consider myself learned enough to
answer that question,” answered Schoeffer, after a
pause. “The scribes who spend their lives in
making libraries should know.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” was the reply. “But, judging
from the works which you have seen, which is the
most celebrated and useful?”</p>

<p>“I recollect,” replied Peter Schoeffer, “when I
was in the Cathedral school, that Father Melchoir
showed us the Gothic Gospels, or Silver Book,
and remarked that more art and expense had been
spent on the Bible than on any other book. From
this I must infer that in the opinion of the wise, it
is the most useful and important book in existence.”</p>

<p>“Right,” replied the inventor; “more time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
has been spent in copying the Bible than any other
book, and justly; for the Word of God is before
all human productions.”</p>

<p>“But is not the Breviary made more prominent
by our priests?”</p>

<p>“Although in more common use, you will notice
that it is not generally so highly ornamented and
so costly as the Bible. This last is the foundation
of the Prayer-book, as also of the institutions of
our religion. Whatever we enjoy of Christianity
and civilization is due to that sacred Book. Hence
it is of all others the most to be prized and preserved.
There are, however, comparatively few copies
of it in the world,&mdash;only two or three thousand,
it is said, and these mostly hoarded in monasteries,
universities, and royal libraries. Suppose now, that
in the conflict of nations, evil should befall the depositories
of the sacred Book, and, through some
devastation or edict, the Bible be lost to us. Moreover,
the Holy Book is sold to kings when they can
afford to pay six hundred crowns for it; if <em>they</em>
may have the Bible, why may not their subjects?
My purpose is to print a Bible in the best style of
my art, and multiply copies of it. I shall need in
this work a skillful engraver of letters.”</p>

<p>“But what an undertaking, to print the entire
Bible!” said Schoeffer.</p>

<p>“Yea, a stupendous work!” was the answer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
“and it will take years to accomplish it; hence I
am the more anxious to begin. Can I not depend
on thy aid?”</p>

<p>Peter Schoeffer had assisted Gutenberg in Strasbourg,
and admired him, and now was only too
happy to accede to his request, and take charge of
designing letters for engraving.</p>

<p>Thus early in the history of his invention did
Gutenberg conceive the project of printing the
Bible; consecrating his art to the honor of God,
and the welfare of his fellow-men. Well does
Mr. Hallam say, “It is a very striking circumstance,
that the high-minded inventors of this great
art tried at the outset so bold a flight as the printing
an entire Bible.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Entering</span> the printing rooms, Gutenberg introduced
Peter Schoeffer to John Faust, and
then called his attention to the new press, which
was a noticeable improvement on those broken up
at Strasbourg.</p>

<p>“Admirable!” exclaimed Schoeffer, as the inventor
explained the working of the machine.
“Good progress has been made since I was in your
shop, years ago.”</p>

<p>As Martin Duttlinger, the workman, dabbed the
type with ink, slid under the platen, and, having
pressed it, removed the printed page, Peter was
delighted with the facility with which the press
operated.</p>

<p>“This is truly wonderful,” cried he. “Pray,
friend Martin, how many impressions can be made
by this press in a day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
“About three hundred, if we work it constantly.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible!” exclaimed Peter. “Now indeed
will books multiply. What will the plodding
copyists say to this?”</p>

<p>Simple man of the ancient time! What would
you say to the speed of our cylinder presses, which
throw off twenty thousand printed sheets an hour,
or more than three hundred a minute! Think of
it, shade of Peter Schoeffer,&mdash;it would take one
hundred and ninety-two thousand of the swiftest
scribes to furnish by copying the same amount as
one of these presses supplies in one hour!</p>

<p>Contrast the speed of the snail and the lightning!</p>

<p>But what was Peter Schoeffer’s personal appearance?
some one asks. We shall let you judge for
yourself,&mdash;in our opinion he was not handsome.
However, as “handsome is that handsome does,” if
we can find in history that he did to others as he
would have others do to him, we will forgive his
plain face, since it was no fault of his. Suppose also
we look at the three together.</p>

<p>The portraits are taken from a medallion, and are
faithful likenesses of the individuals acknowledged
in Germany as the first printers. The subject from
which the picture was copied, is said to have been
engraved by the famous Gubitz of Berlin, from an
old German painting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
We shall become more interested in Schoeffer
when we learn what he achieved; but it is high
time he was described.</p>

<p>His forehead is high, hair scanty and smooth, the
perceptive ridge stands out over the eyes,&mdash;which
are black and piercing,&mdash;nose long and decided,
mouth large and smiling, and the chin entirely hidden
by a flowing beard. He is called the <em>Improver</em>
of the art of printing.</p>

<p>Faust, on the same medallion, is a better-looking
man than Schoeffer, and twenty years his senior.
His brow is not so lofty, but it is care-worn, while
his hair is jet-black. He has the hawk’s eye, keen
nose, and pursy mouth of the shrewd and thrifty
business man. A scanty beard discloses a well-turned
chin, and altogether he makes a fine appearance.
He is distinguished as the <em>Promoter</em> of the
art.</p>

<p>Gutenberg has been already described in a preceding
chapter.</p>

<p>To return to Schoeffer.</p>

<p>Opening his travelling bundle, he produced specimens
of his own hand-writing. These were in
the most elegant style of the practiced monks. The
letters were clear, legible, and uniform, charming
the eye.</p>

<p>“Your nice taste and delicate execution, my son,”
said the inventor, “will nobly aid the art of printing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Abide with us, devote your talents to the art, and
you shall not be the loser.”</p>

<p>“You do me too much honor,” replied Peter.
“I shall only be too happy to serve thee in my
former capacity. I feel that I have everything to
learn in this invention, which has made such advancement
in my absence.”</p>

<p>Gutenberg was by no means a good penman,
neither could he cut very legible letters in type.</p>

<p>But what Gutenberg lacked, Peter Schoeffer
could supply, and the type which was made after
he joined the firm, showed the benefit of his coöperation.</p>

<p>As the wooden type had in a measure failed,
from the necessity of frequent renewal, the company
gradually substituted letters of lead. John
Faust and Schoeffer entered with much interest
upon the experiment of using lead, sanguine of its
success. They still confined themselves to printing
the elementary books. They found no difficulty in
cutting the letters with precision, and they could
put them together as well as those of wood; they
had trouble, however, in printing with them. The
metal was so soft that it required the nicest skill
in turning the screw, as it would scarcely bear
sufficient pressure to print.</p>

<p>See Gutenberg, Faust, and Schoeffer, and the different
members of the firm, around the press in almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
breathless suspense at the trial of the leaden
type!</p>

<p>“This will never do,” exclaimed Faust in dismay,
as the proof-sheet was drawn out, after Gutenberg
had turned the screw. Some of the type were so
much bent as to spoil the letters; others did not
print at all. The experiment was a failure.</p>

<p>“Patience!” cried the inventor, “we shall yet
succeed. Turn you to your type-setting, and let
me manage the press;” and thus he spent the remainder
of the day. Working it by himself, he
found that if the screw was turned to a given point,
it would, under his hand, print without injuring the
type; but when another took his place, it was sure
to be marred.</p>

<p>The artisans were much depressed when they
separated for the night. Gutenberg invited Schoeffer
home to supper, that he might talk over the
matter.</p>

<p>“The lead type is plainly too soft,” remarked
Gutenberg as they sat by the cheerful fire in his
own room in the Zum Jungen. “What we want
is softness and strength, a mixture of qualities.
Another metal should be added.”</p>

<p>“Have you tried iron?” asked Peter.</p>

<p>“Aye, some time since,” was the answer; “but
it pierced the paper so that it could not be used.”</p>

<p>Each then suggested and discussed different combinations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
of metals, and decided to try experiments
until the right alloy was found. And thus the
evening wore away.</p>

<p>One suggestive intellect stirs another. As the
flint elicits the spark from the steel, so two minds
may jointly originate a new thought. Under Gutenberg’s
influence the workings of Peter Schoeffer’s
active brain took shape, and all the inventive faculty
within him was brought into exercise.</p>

<p>Now it so happened, as Nieritz relates, that Peter
was accustomed to experiment in metals, and the
very next day, after sweating over the fire in the
back office, brought in an amalgam which he
thought might answer the purpose. It was a mixture
of regulus of antimony and lead. This
proved to be of the requisite softness and strength.</p>

<p>The day of this discovery was an eventful one.
It was Schoeffer’s first invention. Faust called
Gutenberg aside when he saw how well the new
material worked, to congratulate him.</p>

<p>“Good teachers produce apt scholars,” said he,
patronizingly patting Gutenberg’s shoulder. “I
must wish thee joy of thy apprentice. He takes
to the art like a kitten to milk. We must make
him one of the firm.”</p>

<p>“He is an ingenious workman,” returned Gutenberg,
“and we need all the ability of this kind that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
we can command, for difficulties often occur. I
also am in favor of making him a partner.”</p>

<p>“Moreover, it is so pleasant to have another with
us whom we can trust,” added Faust, “and an old
acquaintance of yours. I am suspicious of strangers.
Our success depends mainly on keeping our secret.”</p>

<p>Happily Schoeffer did not hear all the praise lavished
upon him, but he heard enough to incite him
to diligence and perseverance. Gutenberg was
justly proud of him, and grateful to the kind
Providence that had sent him to the Zum Jungen.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> now view the first printing firm industriously
cutting type from the metal introduced
by Peter Schoeffer, who is one of the partners. Gutenberg,
having fully tested it, found with joy that
it was the long-sought composition. It was hard
enough to bear the necessary pressure, and yet did
not perforate the paper or vellum in printing.</p>

<p>“This is most opportune to our need,” said he
to Peter; “we can now begin to set type for the
Bible. The lead <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i> must be melted into the
new mixture; you shall have charge of it, taking
care to reserve some of the best letters for models.
We must keep in mind that the care with which
the letters are carved will determine the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the book. By lavishing time, ingenuity, and
money on the Bible, the monks have produced some
elaborate specimens. I see no reason why we may
not rival them if we try.”</p>

<p>“Of all books the Bible should be in the highest
style of our art,” remarked Schoeffer.</p>

<p>“True, it should be,” replied Gutenberg; “and
as you have cultivated yourself in penmanship, I
wish you to instruct the firm in type-cutting. I
have thought of a plan by which we can have uniform
and elegant letters. It is that you write them
on the ends of the metal strips, and let others carve
the type from your pattern. This will insure us
one style of handwriting throughout the Bible;
ever keeping in mind that it is our aim to produce
the most beautiful book the world has ever
seen,&mdash;for it is fitting that this book, of all others,
should be issued in the most excellent manner.”</p>

<p>“But,” observed Peter, “how can we excel the
monks, when one man spends a life-time on writing
out and embellishing a Bible, and we can only devote
a few years to it? For instance, how can we
ever bring our Bible to compare with the Silver
Book in the care of Father Melchoir, the letters
of which are mostly of silver, and the illustrations
of gold? I had access to the Royal Library of
France, in the Louvre. There I saw a copy of the
Evangelists, written in liquid gold! I fear we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
fail in magnificence, and give as great a contrast
compared with these monks, as our plain printing rooms
form with that library, the floor of which
is paved with marble, the walls decorated with glass
and ivory, and the shelves and desks are of the
costliest wood.”</p>

<p>“I shall not attempt to rival the monks in adorning
my Bibles with gold and silver,” said Gutenberg;
“if the letters are faultless, and the printing
clear, we shall outvie them, and I am persuaded
that we can effect this. It would be idle for us
to print with gold, even if we had the abundance
to warrant it. The monks are wealthy, and only
lavish it on a single copy, once in many years;
while if we issue one Bible, we shall imprint more
than a hundred!”</p>

<p>“Aye, indeed!” exclaimed Peter Schoeffer,
“What a magnificent thought! Truly we live in
a wonderful age, when six men can make a hundred
Bibles in six years!”</p>

<p>(But what would you say, Peter, could you witness
the lightning-feats of the steam-presses of this
day, dashing off a thousand copies of the sacred volume
in one day?)</p>

<p>“And moreover,” replied Gutenberg, “when
we have disposed of one hundred copies, we can
issue as many more in a shorter time.”</p>

<p>“That is most cheering,” returned Schoeffer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
“and I will at once engage in my department of
the work.”</p>

<p>The printing of the Bible was now the great enterprise
of the firm, smaller works being issued by
way of preparation. While Peter Schoeffer superintended
type-cutting, and the office work went on
as usual, there were long and earnest consultations
as to the best course to pursue in obtaining a Bible
for a copy. If Gutenberg or Faust bargained for
one with the Abbot of a monastery, inquiries would
be made which they wished not to answer.</p>

<p>“If I had the money to deposit for a Bible,”
said Martin Duttlinger, “I could easily obtain one.”</p>

<p>“And the money we expect to furnish, of
course,” said Faust. “No one can borrow so
valuable a piece of property as a Bible, without
the same as buying it.”</p>

<p>It was accordingly arranged that Martin Duttlinger,
who was the most trusty of their workmen,
should be charged with the mission of buying a
Bible of Trithemius, Abbot of Spanheim, who was
known to have books for sale; and Martin was
accordingly fitted off. After his departure, affairs
went on with the firm much as usual, save that they
felt the impulse which the resolve of engaging in
the noblest enterprise on earth could not fail to
give; and who can doubt that the smile of God’s
countenance rested on them, lightening their toil?</p>

  <div class="caption">ANCIENT PRESS.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Gutenberg and Faust advised much together respecting
the improved printing machine they were
adjusting, and Schoeffer made rapid improvement
in his particular branch of the art.</p>

<p>Gutenberg’s press was very simple in construction,&mdash;a
board acted on by a screw, like a cheese-press.
On this board the type was placed inclosed
in a frame, then inked; the paper was then laid
over them, and the screw turned by a lever with
the hand. In constructing this press, he had two
upright posts of great strength, seven feet and a
half high, placed four feet apart, and fastened together
at the top and bottom by two stout crosspieces.
In this frame an iron screw was made to
work, by means of two parallel additional crosspieces,
about a foot and a half apart, connecting the
perpendicular posts. From about the middle of
each of these upright posts, three feet from the
floor, a slide projected, called a rib; these posts
were parallel to each other, and firmly fitted, to
bear a great weight. But these two points of the
press,&mdash;the <em>screw</em> and the <em>slide</em>,&mdash;let us see of
what use they were. A table was made to run in
under the frame and out, the slide supporting it in
place of legs. The screw worked in a box, called
a hose, by means of a bar or lever inserted in it;
the toe, or lower end of the screw, working in a
sort of cup fixed upon a large block of dense wood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
having the face planed smooth, and called the platen.
By turning down the bar, the screw forced down
the platen, which was fastened to it, just as far as
it descended; when the screw was raised, the
platen was also raised.</p>

<p>The frame or chase which contained the type being
fixed upon the table, it was made to slide backwards
and forwards as was needed. For example,
when the type was ready to be pressed, having been
previously inked, and the paper laid upon it, the
workman slid it under the platen; and after the
screw was turned down, and the platen had pressed
it, or the printing was done, he slid it out.</p>

<p>The inking balls were constructed of a variety of
things, and at length the printers used those which
were made of sheep’s felt.</p>

<p>A sheet of paper being placed upon the type, the
form was slid directly under the platen; and this
being pressed down by a handle turning the screw,
the paper was printed.</p>

<p>This press served very well then, and even almost
to our own day; a similar one is sometimes
to be seen now, where common rough printing
is required.</p>

<p>The press-work, being very toilsome, was done by
turns, one man plying it a certain number of hours,
then another taking his place. The Alphabet, with
the “Lord’s Prayer,” the “Address to the Virgin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mary,” a “Dictionary,” and a “Donatus,” were
the first works printed with the improved press,
and separate types.</p>

<p>Each of these first printers was eminently practical.
Had they been otherwise, never could so
great a work have been executed. It is now necessary
to employ as many as twelve trades to publish
a Bible. These are type-founders, printers’ joiners,
iron-founders, paper-makers, wholesale stationers,
letter-press printers, printing-ink makers, composition-roller
makers, engravers on wood, lithographic
printers, hot-pressers, and book-binders. But those
three men, of whom Gutenberg was chief, wrought
at most of these branches of business with their
own hands, or by the workmen whom they taught,
in the printing rooms of the Zum Jungen.</p>

<p>Schoeffer had great skill and facility in getting
out the cut type, as well as in directing others to
work after his models. When he had wrought at
it some time and prepared a quantity of type, Gutenberg
said to <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Our initial letters must be illuminated,
and as you have had much practice in this department
of writing, being an illuminator of manuscript
works, I doubt not you will execute them as they
should be.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” replied Schoeffer, pleasantly.
The result was that in a short time he had designed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
and cut a number of illuminated letters, to
be used at the beginning of chapters. As a specimen
of his handiwork, we give the initial B, taken
from a work of the Mentz press, and described on
the following page.</p>

<p>Let us carefully notice this exquisite letter. On
the left hand are elaborated fern leaves and other
foliage; while the centre is dense with climbing
luxuriance. On the right, in the broad curves of
the initial, are delicate flowers suggestive of snow
crystals, cerastium, and mignonnette,&mdash;dainty bits
of infloresence just fitted to alight with feathery
footfall on the back of the elephantine letter. On
the other side is a bird taking its flight, and a dog
pursuing. The letter itself originally was in pale
blue, the ornaments in which it was placed being
red; the figures and flowers were transparent and
white, as well as the vellum on which the book was
printed; showing that the art of engraving was no
longer in its infancy, and also that the artist was
well practiced in his profession.</p>

<p>Well done, Peter Schoeffer! we cannot sufficiently
admire thy taste, patience, and perseverance.
What an infinite deal of labor and pains it
cost thee to design and engrave hundreds of these
illuminated letters for the Bible! Besides, there
was the general superintendence of type-cutting;
for every letter was drafted by the same hand. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
are puzzled to think where you acquired your skill.
It is said that you were famously started under the
fostering care of Father Melchoir, himself a good
copyist, and then improved your style by two years’
application at the University of Paris. And all
this that the Bible may be fittingly printed! Little
did you think when a student at the Cathedral of
Strasbourg, for what you were studying. Neither
did it occur to you while your eye was schooled for
the conception, and your hand for the execution of
beauty, at Paris, for what you were preparing.</p>

<p>In due time Martin returned from his mission,
bearing a Bible in manuscript, in a satchel on his
back, and great were the rejoicings and congratulations
of the firm and their families.</p>

<p>Gutenberg, Faust, and Schoeffer now became
more and more absorbed in the various divisions
of the art of printing, preparatory to setting the
Bible in type in the best style.</p>

<p>The simple branch of inventing and making ink,
for example, cost time and patience; many experiments
being tried before the right combination was
found. Common writing ink would not answer,
being so liquid as to deface the paper with blots.
Finally, a mixture of linseed oil and lamp-black or
soot was tried, and found to possess the right consistence.
They succeeded so well in compounding
it that, as one has said, “their works show a depth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
and richness of color which excites the envy of the
moderns; nor has it turned brown, or rendered
the surrounding paper in the least degree dingy.”
It was applied to the type by dabbers. These were
balls of skin stuffed with wool, precisely like those
used forty years ago. The types were disposed in
cases much as they are now.</p>

<p>The firm was getting on finely, having prepared
several hundred pounds’ weight of type for the Bible,
when Schoeffer, getting weary of this monotonous
cutting, “and being ardently desirous to improve
the art,” bethought him of trying to invent
a simpler and speedier method of preparing type.</p>

<p>It is interesting to follow this scribe, belonging
to an ancient and honorable craft, as he helped
pull it down to build up one infinitely better. It
was like taking down a cottage from a goodly site,
to make room for a Crystal Palace that would last
through all time. Not that Schoeffer was alone in
this enterprise; he simply aided others. He may
have suggested the new device of casting type, and
indeed some go as far as to give him the entire
credit of the conception and execution of this process.
He had taste, culture, and adaptation to circumstances;
Gutenberg was ingenious, and Faust
wealthy; and there was every motive to arouse
Schoeffer’s mind to activity. Says a discriminating
English writer, “It seems most probable that where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
three ingenious men are bound together by art and
interest, no one of them can lay exclusive claim to
any invention or undertaking executed in the work-shops
and for mutual benefit. Allowing, therefore,
to Schoeffer the honor of having hinted the plan,
the other two may fairly put in a claim for their
portion of the credit on the score of their assistance,
especially since Gutenberg and Faust, being mechanics,
would have engaged and directed the workmen.”</p>

<p>Evidently at the suggestion of Schoeffer, the firm
began to take casts of type in moulds of plaster.
This improvement on the old method was really a
great step onward, although the process of casting
was slow and tedious. A new mould was required
for each letter; and let the workman be ever so
vigilant, no care could enable him to impress fully
and steadily into a soft substance so small a thing
as a type is at the face, while yet so long in the
shank; accordingly, when he succeeded well in his
attempt, after the casting, there was a process of
finishing, to give it the well-defined sharpness absolutely
necessary in type. This improvement therefore
was rather unsatisfactory, and led to much
consultation of the printers how they could carry it
still further. And here Peter Schoeffer’s practical
talent appeared; for “it was he who first planned
the cutting of punches, whereby not only might the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
most beautiful form of type the taste and skill of
the artist could suggest, be fairly stamped upon the
matrix, but a degree of finish quite unattainable in
type cut in metal or wood could be given to the
face; whilst to the shank, by the very same process
by which the face was cast, the mould would give
perfect sharpness and precision of angle.”</p>

<p>History relates that Peter Schoeffer privately cut
matrices for the whole alphabet, and showed the
letters cast from them to Gutenberg and Faust.</p>

<p>“Are these letters cast in moulds?” asked the
latter, in great astonishment.</p>

<p>“They are,” replied Schoeffer.</p>

<p>“Mirabile! this surpasses all!” exclaimed he.
“Why, you are showing yourself a great genius, I
must acknowledge. How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight!” replied Peter.</p>

<p>“I seldom flatter, but you are a young man of
promise; and I predict that you will make your
mark in the world! I suppose you think that is
slight praise, for a practiced scribe ought to be able
to write his name in gold letters,&mdash;making his
mark is said of those who can only make a mark
for their name;” and Faust laughed at his own
wit. “But you know what I mean. In my opinion,
you will yet come to distinction!”</p>

<p>But how shall we describe the emotions of those
first printers, those cool yet enthusiastic men, as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
beheld the first printed page of the Bible! The
press worked admirably; the type was uniform and
elegant; and the expression given on the vellum,
unequaled in beauty. At sight of it a glow of
honest pride filled each heart; and how could the
most undevout repress emotions of praise to God?</p>

<p>We have a glimpse of the little company in the
frontispiece, taken from an old painting. This was
in the spring of 1450, a year memorable as commencing
the issue of the famous Mazarine Bible.
But with all the toil and diligence bestowed upon
it, it was not completed until five years after, in
1455.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was now in the early part of October, 1455;
and of late, Faust, to whom history gives the
title of Doctor, had become dissatisfied with Gutenberg,
on the ground that returns did not come in
fast enough for the money invested. The Bible
had been issued, it is true; but as it had been at
great expense, and its sale was small, his enthusiasm
in regard to it declined; and although once so
warm a friend and patron of Gutenberg, he grew
cold-hearted and scheming. He was, however, increasingly
cordial to Peter Schoeffer, and one day
invited him to supper. Flattered by the attention,
Peter appeared promptly at the rooms of the Doctor,
his toilet made with unusual care. It was in the
early evening, and a fire was being kindled in the
large room into which Peter was ushered. Madam
Faust, an invalid, sat in her arm-chair wrapped in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
shawl, to shield her from the chilliness, as a driving
rain was pelting without. Christiane, the daughter,
a young lady of twenty-five,&mdash;and Peter thought
he never saw her look more beautiful,&mdash;cordially
greeted him, and placed a seat for him.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, master!” said Faust urbanely,
rising and shaking his hand. “Sit nearer the fire,
master; the room will be warm soon.”</p>

<p>In the course of the conversation which followed,
Faust said, “Gutenberg gaineth little in inventing.
According to my thinking, he cannot be named the
same day with yourself, Peter. You devised the
ink, the forms for casting type, and the mixture of
metals; and these are nearly all that has been invented.
I regret to say it, but it would be a good
thing for the firm if Gutenberg would even retire,
so great is his extravagance. Why, he expended
4,000 florins before the Bible was half done! How
he can ever pay me for the sums I let him have, I
do not comprehend.”</p>

<p>“Economy is certainly useful,” observed Peter
in a general way.</p>

<p>“A just and sensible remark,” replied Faust.
“Your printer’s ink shows that you mean what you
say; it is admirable, it is so cheap.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you think so, master,” replied Peter,
glancing with a proud flush at Christiane.</p>

<p>“I often say to my wife and daughter,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Faust, “that if justice were done, you would
be the acknowledged inventor, since you are continually
making improvements, while he invents
nothing, so to speak. Moreover, he is extravagant,
and the business will be ridden to death with debt.”</p>

<p>Peter was more than gratified that his efforts
were appreciated by the Doctor; but he revered
Gutenberg, and was shocked at the proposal to
eject him from the business, and he ventured to
<span class="locked">say,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I owe much to Master Gutenberg.”</p>

<p>“True,” replied Faust; “but if you were not
dependent, you would acquire more in one week by
your unfailing genius than he could impart in a
year. The faculty to contrive and discover is in
you; and if we were once rid of him, a great revenue
would accrue. In due time you would be rich
and renowned.”</p>

<p>The fire burned briskly, throwing out a genial
warmth; the watch-dog basked on his mat, opening
and shutting his eyes in calm content; Madam
Faust’s delicate face became pink in the ruddy
glow; Christiane’s cheeks were abloom; the kettle
sang from its long hook on the crane; a servant
glided softly around as she laid the table. Peter
fell into a dreamy abstraction.</p>

<p>“If I could even do it honorably,” he murmured
half unconsciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
“Honorably! certainly thou canst,” emphatically
returned Faust. “Dost thou think I would counsel
thee to do that which would be otherwise?
Business is business, and one must look out first for
one’s self. Thou mayest have qualms of diffidence
in severing the old tie, having served so faithfully
under him; but we will be answerable for the
change: we will see that he retires from the firm,
and thou shalt not be blamed. Agreeing to this, I
will insure thee the use of my money to the extent
of my means.”</p>

<p>“Wife, I hope you have something palatable for
Master Schoeffer,” said Faust, as all were seated
by the table, and he helped his guest. Then, returning
to the subject of their <span class="locked">conversation,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Aye, leave me alone in disposing of this matter.
I’ve a little case in law, which, for my brother’s
sake, I shall set afoot. Gutenberg is culpably
careless of money. It is shocking to see one thus
making shipwreck of conscience. Of the 2,020
florins which I lent him, he has not returned one
obolus. He has not even paid the interest.”</p>

<p>“He has not!” exclaimed Peter. “What can
he be thinking of?”</p>

<p>“Of himself,” replied Faust. “As long as he
has money, what cares he who goes without? I
can only do business in a business way; and I
shall immediately call him to account; and, Master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Schoeffer, our firm shall be established on a firm
basis.”</p>

<p>Poor Peter was too well pleased with Faust’s flatteries,
and, yielding to the stronger will of his host,
had listened to adroit insinuations against Gutenberg
until his heart grew hard. The Doctor was
quick at reading character, and knew how to turn
Peter’s interest in Christiane to account, and, when
his guest rose to leave, <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“But, Master Schoeffer, you are by far too industrious.
You are worn with work, and need relaxation.
You ought at least to devote these magnificent
moonlight evenings to recreation. My boat
is always at your service, and here’s Christiane&mdash;if
you cannot find better company&mdash;give her an
airing on our beautiful river.”</p>

<p>Schoeffer had often raised his eyes from his work
to glance at the lovely vision of Christiane, as she
flitted by on her morning rambles; but, proud and
retiring, had felt the pecuniary distance there was
between her father and himself; and though he
sometimes fancied she was not indifferent to his admiration,
they had not until that evening spoken together.
It seemed like a dream; for now in her
presence her father had lavished attentions upon
him, and predicted for him fame and fortune.</p>

<p>The next morning, Gutenberg, in order to urge
on the work, early toiled at the press-work of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Bible; for so slow and laborious was the process
that comparatively few copies were completed.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Peter,” said he, unsuspicious
of evil, as Schoeffer entered, and a workman took
his place at the press. “You have not told me by
what proportion of metals you have secured the
requisite strength and softness of type.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Master,” replied Peter with half
averted face, “let me keep that little secret. I may
have to try again.” Gutenberg was grieved by
the answer as only a noble and sensitive mind can
be by the slights of one who has been nourished
like a child. He resumed his work, while the foreboding
of the approaching storm fell on his spirit
like a dark shadow.</p>

<p>Peter felt ill at ease; and a consciousness of the
despicable part he was playing, at times brought
the mantling blush of shame to his cheek; but he
hardened himself against conviction, by magnifying
his own improvements and dreaming of future
greatness. Besides, he had really been prejudiced
by Faust against Gutenberg, and his mind was
much occupied with the image of the amiable and
charming Christiane; and he feared to offend the
father lest he might not win the daughter.</p>

<p>“When do you propose to pay me?” abruptly
asked John Faust of Gutenberg some days later.</p>

<p>“Pay you!” ejaculated the other in great surprise,
“I am not aware that I owe you anything!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
“Not aware of it!” angrily retorted the Doctor.
“Not aware of the 2,020 florins and other large
sums I lent you! I will give you thirty days in
which to pay the debt; and if then you fail to do
so, I shall take measures to collect it!”</p>

<p>“Hard conditions truly, even supposing I owed
you! But the sums you mention were used for
our common benefit, and we are in the midst of our
first edition of the Bible. I have no way of raising
money save from its sale, which it will take
months to effect.”</p>

<p>“That is not to the point,” replied Faust. “I
want the money, and the money I must have. My
brother James advanced it.”</p>

<p>“But how am I to procure it? Would you ruin
me?”</p>

<p>“Am I to devise means for you to pay your
debts to me?” was the heartless rejoinder. “The
money I must have; and if you are an honest
man, you will pay it: understand me!” and Faust
abruptly left. As he had entered, Peter was missing,
and did not soon return. Gutenberg had only
Martin and Hanau with him, and was too much
overcome to speak. Was it for this that he had
climbed almost to the pinnacle of his hopes? Martin
was full of sympathy, and even Hanau’s vacillating
heart was touched. Gutenberg saw that Faust
and Schoeffer were leagued against him. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
barbed iron had pierced his roul. Press-work and
proof-reading were not to be thought of. He
sought his room in the lethargy of despair. The
prospect that the printing of the glorious Bible
would be arrested, the fear that his beloved art
would be torn from him, appalled him. Days
passed, the darkness of affliction continued unbroken.
Anna feared that he would sink under
his load. True wife that she was, she intuitively
understood, soothed, and offered him the comforts
of faith and trust, and bore his burdens like a
very heroine. She was his ministering angel, and
at length he emerged from his gloom in a measure
and returned to the printing rooms, still oppressed
with the thought that he had been cruelly
wounded in the house of his friends.</p>

<p>Punctual to the day the Doctor appeared, accompanied
by his brother, James Faust; the former
having of late partly resumed goldsmithing, although
still a member of the firm.</p>

<p>“The month has expired, and I have come for
the money!” said Faust.</p>

<p>“I have not been able to raise it,” replied Gutenberg.</p>

<p>“But it is high time that it was paid,” said John
Faust. “It is nearly five years since it was borrowed.
You promised that we should make our
fortunes long before this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
“I did not name the time of paying any sum,”
returned the inventor, “nor did I borrow the
money, but it was put into the firm for our mutual
advantage. You were, moreover, to pay me eight
hundred florins for my personal use, in consideration
of my teaching you the secrets of my art.
This was not paid me, but was put into the funds
of the association for our joint benefit.”</p>

<p>“It was borrowed money, every florin!” cried
Faust, “and you are holden for it. If no time was
specified for payment, on demand is of course understood.”</p>

<p>“As to the other sums,” continued Gutenberg,
“I can give you an exact account of them; but
I am not liable for the interest, since you had an
equivalent for my use of the money, and indeed
appropriated it equally with myself.”</p>

<p>“There is a way of settling that point,” significantly
remarked James Faust, as the two took
leave; and shortly he instituted a process of law,
and procured from the notary public the following
<span class="locked">document:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“To the glory of God, Amen. Be it known to
all those who see or read this instrument, that in
the year of our Lord 1455, third indiction, Thursday,
6th day of November, the first year of the
Pontificate of our very Holy Father the Pope Calixtus
III., approved here at Mayence, in the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
parlor of the Barefooted Friars, between 11 o’clock
and midday, before me, the notary, and the undersigned
witnesses, the honorable and discreet person
James Faust, citizen of Mayence, who in the name
of his brother, John Faust, also present, has said
and declared clearly that on this said day at the
present hour, and in the same parlor of the Barefooted
Friars, John Gutenberg should see and hear
taken by John Faust an oath conformably to a sentence
pronounced between them. And this sentence
read in the presence of the Honorable Henry
Gunter, Curé of St. Christopher’s of Mayence, of
Henry Keffler, and De Becktoff de Hanau, servant
and valet of the said Gutenberg: John Faust, placing
his hand upon the Holy Evangelists, has sworn
between the hands of me, the notary public, comformable
to the sentence pronounced, and has taken
the following oath, word for word: ‘I, John Faust,
have borrowed 1,550 florins, which I have transmitted
to John Gutenberg, which have been employed
for our common labor, and of which I have paid
the rent and annual interest, of which I still owe
a part. Reckoning therefore for each hundred florins
borrowed, six florins per annum, I demand of
him the repayment, and the interest, conformably
to the sentence pronounced, which I will prove in
equity to be legal, in consequence of my claim upon
the said John Gutenberg.’ In presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Honorable H. Gunter, of Henry Keffler, and of
Becktoff de Hanau aforesaid, John Faust has demanded
of me an authentic instrument to serve him
as much and as often as he hath need, and in the
faith of which I have signed this instrument, and
have set thereto my seal.”</p>

<p>The law took its course. The inexorable judges
made no allowance for the peculiar circumstances
of the case, but gave judgment against Gutenberg,
awarding that he should pay to Faust whatever he
had borrowed, with interest. This decision was
made November 1455. As Gutenberg had no means
of paying the sums demanded, Faust took possession
of his presses, type, printing materials, and the
copies of the Bible, finished and unfinished.</p>

<p>Gutenberg had been sustained, during the sitting
of the court in the parlor of the Barefoot Friars,
by the suspense and excitement of the scene. He
had hoped for justice, or at least for a more favorable
decision; but instead of that, everything was
taken from him. Reaching home, he knew not
how, after long wandering in unfrequented places,
he threw himself upon his couch, and made no reply
to the affectionate inquiries of Anna. She
knew that the cause had gone against him, and that
he was in the extremity of trouble. As he gave
way to his trial, although herself in deep grief, her
heart somehow grew stronger. There had been a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
marked change in her since residing at the Zum
Jungen. As she realized that good would result
from her husband’s inventions, she strove to encourage
him in his devotion to his art. In his despair,
she was buoyed up by hope. For long hours
he seemed scarcely to notice her gentle presence.
She did not disturb him with words; but as the
hours stole by, and his grief was heavy on him, she
drew the curtains till the room was in the hush of
twilight, hoping that balmy sleep would overtake
him; then, sitting by his side, she prayed earnestly,
silently, for him. When he awoke after a refreshing
sleep, he was more like himself.</p>

<p>“Dost thou know, my Anna,” he calmly said,
“that Faust has laid claim to everything, including
my presses, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i>, and the printed pages of
the Holy Bible now ready to be bound?”</p>

<p>“Can it be possible?” ejaculated Anna in dismay.</p>

<p>“And I am worse than penniless,” he added.
“My noble art is at an end. That which I most
feared has come upon me. Others have stolen my
invention and I have nothing left.”</p>

<p>“But we are taught by our holy religion,” she
quickly responded, brushing away her tears, “that
it is good to trust in the Lord in times of trouble,
and if we have faith in him, he will deliver us.”</p>

<p>Yet sorely was the inventor tried; and month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
after month, the weary time crept on, Gutenberg
and Anna in poverty and affliction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Faust, having taken possession of
everything that could be called Gutenberg’s, organized
a new company by associating Schoeffer and
others with himself, and finished binding the remaining
copies of the Bible as rapidly as possible.
As Faust and Schoeffer examined it anew, they
were filled with admiration.</p>

<p>“This book will bring handsome returns, Peter,”
said the former, “if we manage wisely. My
brother is of opinion that I can sell fifty copies in
Paris alone!”</p>

<p>“A happy suggestion!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And I must go at once,” said Faust; and, with
characteristic energy, he commenced making preparations
for the journey. As a sufficient number
of Bibles were ready for the present demand,
Schoeffer and the journeymen were to employ
themselves in issuing “Litterariæ Indulgentiæ,” a
one page work much prized by the monks.</p>

<p>Schoeffer had now been married to Faust’s
daughter for some months, and was an honored
member of the firm. But although his worldly prospects
were fair, yet he was less happy than he had
imagined, and the memory of his old master’s kindness
often brought penitent tears to his eyes. He
longed to see him, as formerly, the ruling spirit in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the printing rooms, but had not moral courage and
decision of purpose enough to say this in the presence
of Faust. Besides, he still wished to appropriate
riches and fame to himself. So he persisted
in the wrong, salving his conscience with the promise
that he would at some time do right by Gutenberg.</p>

Psalter.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">One</span> balmy morning in the spring of 1456,
Faust, with a stock of beautifully bound Bibles,
started for Paris, some four hundred miles distant.
Sailing down the Rhine to Strasbourg, he then
travelled by the public road over mountains and
across the country nearly west to the French metropolis,
then a long and toilsome journey.</p>

<p>On his arrival, he engaged a shop on the Rue
St. George, where he could safely store his treasures.</p>

<p>Hastening to call upon the King, he made known
his errand and offered him a copy of the Bible for
seven hundred and fifty crowns!</p>

<p>As the King examined it, he was delighted with
the regular and beautiful writing.</p>

<p>“It is true,” said he, “that the scribes ask only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
five and six hundred crowns for a copy of their
Bible, but I have never seen anything equal to
this! I will gladly pay thee thy price, and consider
it a rare bargain.”</p>

<p>Faust next sought out the Archbishop.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he said, taking the large package
from the porter who accompanied him, and unrolling
it from its folds of vellum, “I have brought
thee a Bible executed with great care and finish.
Permit me to call thy attention to it.”</p>

<p>“It is very finely executed,” observed the Archbishop
as he turned its leaves. “What is your
price?”</p>

<p>“Only three hundred crowns!” answered Faust.</p>

<p>“I will willingly pay that,” replied the Archbishop.
“It is seldom that we can obtain a work
made in this style, and so cheap. I am familiar
with the copyists of monasteries, but have never
met the monk that carried so even a hand!”</p>

<p>Making no explanations, Faust took the money,
and returned to his lodgings on St. George’s Street,
where in a few days he privately sold some half-dozen
more copies. Citizens now began to gather
to admire the wonderful book.</p>

<p>At first he only exhibited one at a time, and the
impression went abroad that the books were very
scarce; hence people were more anxious to buy,
and readily paid the fifty crowns which he asked
lay purchasers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
For a time each one who bought a Bible thought
himself especially favored, supposing that his was
the only copy of the kind to be found. As a writer
has said, “The beauty of the work, the elegance
of the flower-pieces, and the variety of the finest
colors which were intermixed with gold and silver,
led many persons to show their purchases to their
friends, each one thinking, as he produced his, that
the whole world could not contain such another.”</p>

<p>As for the Archbishop, he was so elated with his
copy, that he could not rest until he had carried it
to the King, who, greatly surprised, in return
showed his own. On comparing them, they noticed
that the ornaments were not exactly the same.
They were not gilded precisely alike, and the initial
letters were painted differently. But in other
respects, the part which they supposed written, the
number of pages, lines, and letters were the same;
and they began to surmise that those Bibles were
made in some new way. No man could have
copied them both, and made them so entirely similar.
Besides, to write out two such Bibles would
have exceeded the work of a man’s life; and the
materials on which he wrote would wax old with
age meanwhile, but these were new and fresh.
The King and the Archbishop were sorely puzzled;
and rumor was not long in bringing to their ears
that Faust had sold quite a number, some at fifty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
crowns, some at twelve, and others still as low as
six pounds, while the supply continued equal to the
demand. All Paris was agitated.</p>

<p>“What can this mean?” said the King.</p>

<p>“What can this mean?” echoed the Archbishop.</p>

<p>“These books were made by no earthly power!”
exclaimed an ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>“The Evil One had a hand in it!” cried the
ever-at-hand courtiers.</p>

<p>And although the Bibles were beautiful, costly,
and desirable, these good people deemed it necessary
to put an immediate stop to their further sale.
Much as they prized them, they could not encourage
collusion with the powers of darkness. In the
midst of this excitement two professors of the University
of Paris, as Neiritz informs us, came in and
purchased a Bible. A servant bore it after them as
they left the shop.</p>

<p>“Antoine,” exclaimed one of them to the other,
“it is a wonder to me how the German Doctor can
afford to sell this Bible for six pounds! Who ever
saw such beautiful writing? It is so uniform, I
cannot cease admiring the book. Andre, bring it
hither!” and as the servant brought it forward,
and it was again opened, a circle gathered to examine
it.</p>

<p>“How very beautiful!” exclaimed Professor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Antoine, “it scarcely could be done by mortal
hands.”</p>

<p>“The thing is not possible!” said the brother
professor.</p>

<p>“It is done by the famous black art!” affirmed
a voice in the crowd.</p>

<p>“Yes, look at those black pot-hooks and hangers!”
exclaimed another.</p>

<p>“Father Clement says it is the work of magic
and witchcraft!” said a third.</p>

<p>“The German Doctor has made a bargain with
the Evil One, being taught the black art as an offset
for going to perdition.”</p>

<p>“Well, Antoine,” remarked the first professor,
mirthfully, “if magic and witchcraft can make
Bibles in this style, keep them at it early and late,
and get out of them all the good you can. Besides,
a house divided against itself cannot stand.”</p>

<p>But people generally took the matter more to
heart than did the genial professor, and, as they
chatted about it and thought it over, were more and
more satisfied that other than mortal hands had
fabricated the Bibles.</p>

<p>“Only to think of it, so many copies just alike,
and made so rapidly! And the more you take
away from the shop, the more there are for sale!
Parisians are as quick-fingered as any other nation,
but not one of our fleetest scribes can write in this
way; neither can any man do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
So the mob searched Faust’s lodgings, or the
shop on Rue St. George, and seized a great number
of Bibles. “Behold,” said they when they saw the
red ink with which they were embellished, “this is
his blood!”</p>

<p>The city authorities were at once apprised that
he was a magician! And accordingly orders were
given to apprehend Dr. Faust for being in league
with Satan, and for dealing in the black art.</p>

<p>“What have I done?” asked Dr. Faust, as the
police officers appeared in his shop to take him.</p>

<p>“Only a small thing truly!” ironically replied
one of them; “this indictment says that you turn
off books by witchcraft.”</p>

<p>“Never!” exclaimed Faust; “I have made them
in an honest way!”</p>

<p>But the officers shrugged their shoulders, and
took him along.</p>

<p>Faust was in trouble. If he confessed the truth,
others would seize his art and profits; and if he
did not, his life might be sacrificed. While he was
revolving the matter, he was thrust into prison.</p>

<p>For once he was at his wit’s end, and almost
paralyzed by the turn affairs had taken. What!
he, the man of wealth and the patron of printing,
in prison, classed with felons! It seemed to him
like a horrible nightmare, only the chilliness of the
cell and the damp straw brought on his old rheumatism,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
reminding him too well that it was all
reality.</p>

<p>“I shall die here!” he groaned, as he sleeplessly
tossed on the straw; “I must reveal the
secret, and save my life!” Never was a more
restless prisoner. Sleep! he would as soon think
of it on a plank in the open sea. In the morning
the court set, and Faust was brought to the bar.</p>

  <div class="caption">SPECIMEN OF PSALTER, PSALM I.</div></div>

<p>Bibles were produced and compared, witnesses
were not wanting, and the case was strong against
him, when he was called on for his defense. Perfectly
calm, and self-possessed he thus addressed
the <span class="locked">judge:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“May it please your Honor: It is not the
black art that I practice, but the art of printing.
This newly discovered art was first devised by
John Gutenberg of Mayence, and afterwards more
fully improved by his journeyman, Peter Schoeffer,
and myself. I can in a short time so describe the
process to you that you may yourself set type and
print. We employ young men to help in the
work, and there is no more black art in it than
there is in planting a garden. Think you the Evil
One would lend his aid to the work of multiplying
copies of a book that describes him and his wiles,
warning men against him and predicting his doom!
Nay, your Honor, the thing is absurd. We Germans
lead the way in this matter of printing books,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>begging
your Honor’s pardon, while I say it,&mdash;but
it will not be long before printing machines will be
common in Paris.”</p>

<p>Such was Faust’s defence, which so wrought upon
the lively crowd that they were enthusiastic in
their cries of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive le Docteur! vive le Docteur!</i>”
The magistrates eagerly withdrew the charges
against him; and the sequel was that some of the
nobility of Paris made him a magnificent pecuniary
reward.</p>

<p>When Faust returned from Paris, he prosecuted
the business of printing with renewed energy. He
could well do this, as his enterprise had been very
remunerative. Besides issuing the “Litterariæ Indulgentiæ,”
he urged on the completion of the
Psalter, an elaborate work which had been in press
two years and a half, before the lawsuit overtook
the firm. As it was not published until August,
1457, it was four years in being brought to perfection.
It bore the colophon of Faust and Schoeffer,
and was the first book that had the name of the
place where it was printed, the name of its printers,
and the year when it was printed.</p>

<p>That this elegant book was partly the work of
Gutenberg, is evident from the fact that it was
four years in being published, and was issued
only eighteen months after the partnership was
dissolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
It was printed in large cut type, with illuminated
initials; and as it is impossible that Gutenberg’s
works could have been undone, a new fount prepared,
and so splendid a book printed, in so short a
time, it is plain that this was the identical Psalter
on which the labor of two years and a half had
been expended, before Faust sued Gutenberg. It
was the latter who proposed to bring it out, and
who superintended the construction of the type
and ornaments. The superb initial letters, of
which the initial B in this volume is a specimen,
were projected and criticised by Gutenberg. It is
true that Schoeffer’s practiced hand executed them,
but the original idea was suggested by the leading
spirit of the company.</p>

<p>Yet this Psalter appeared in 1457 with the colophon
or monogram of Faust and Schoeffer.</p>

<div id="ip_190" class="figcenter" style="width: 164px;">
  <img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="164" height="124" alt="" /></div>

<p>This was a device indicating something respecting
the authors or proprietors of a volume, and,
in this case, was composed of two <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ecus</i>, or shields,
which were taken from the armorial bearings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
their families. As Gutenberg was of the nobility,
some have affirmed that the monogram alluded to
was his device, and adopted by the three partners
before they separated; if otherwise, and it simply
referred to Faust and Schoeffer, these partners did
an act of great injustice in omitting his name from
the colophon or conclusion of the Psalter.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Was</span> the art for which Gutenberg had toiled all
his life, forever to be torn from him, and his
rivals alone garner the fruits? In his despondency
Anna was hopeful. She would often say to <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“There will be a way of deliverance. Thou
has wintered with misfortunes ere this, and camest
forth unharmed; and now, even if everything is
taken, God can change the hearts of those who
have wronged thee, and incline others to enlist in
thy behalf.”</p>

<p>“Those are noble sentiments,” Gutenberg
would reply; “and if all things else are adverse,
my Anna is true, and gives me good counsel.”</p>

<p>Genuine faith is never unrewarded; and as if to
encourage Anna, about this time Friele Gutenberg,
having returned from Venice, where he had spent
some years, visited his brother at the Zum Jungen.
Gutenberg told him the story of his art, and how,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
when he had nearly completed the Bible, he was
overwhelmed by a lawsuit, being unjustly required
to pay money to Faust before he could raise anything
from the sales.</p>

<p>Friele was shocked at the recital; and at his
request Gutenberg conducted him to the printing
rooms, and showed him copies of the Bible.</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Friele, “this is indeed wonderful!
It is the most beautiful book I ever beheld.
And is the issuing of it entirely taken out
of thy hands, my brother?”</p>

<p>“It is even so,” was the reply. “I have been
constrained to retire from the firm, and have no
means to prosecute the art which has been the
study of my life.”</p>

<p>“But yours is a success,” said Friele. “You
ought to be encouraged. I will aid you to the extent
of my ability, and influence my friends to do
something for you. There is also something due
you from our father’s estate, which will soon be settled;
and this, with other sums, will establish you
in business under favorable auspices.”</p>

<p>This was so unexpected that Gutenberg, overcome,
could only press his brother’s hand in grateful
silence.</p>

<p>Friele’s sympathies were indeed earnestly enlisted
in his brother’s cause. The injustice and ingratitude
of Faust and Schoeffer stirred his indignation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
and he resolved that the true inventor should again
engage in his chosen vocation. He soon sought out
his sister Hebele, who, although a nun in the St.
Claire Convent, was not wholly inaccessible to her
brothers. She retained her old affection for her
favorite John, and, on hearing Friele’s rehearsal of
his successful invention and subsequent losses, voluntarily
offered to loan him the sixty florins which was
soon to be paid her from the estate of her father.</p>

<p>“My noble Hebele!” exclaimed Friele enthusiastically,
“that is so like thyself! How it will encourage
John! I will do as much on my part, and
I doubt not we shall soon have the gratification of
again seeing him prosperously printing.”</p>

<p>Friele was a man of standing and influence in the
city, and lost no time in conferring with his friend,
Conrad Humery, Syndic of Mentz. This good dignitary
became so deeply interested in Friele’s accounts
of his brother John’s struggles, triumphs,
and wrongs, that he begged at once to be introduced
to him. Friele accordingly accompanied him
to the Zum Jungen, where they found John Gutenberg
in a back room, busy polishing gems, and
Anna diligent at her embroidery frame.</p>

<p>The Syndic was past middle age, affable and
easy, the goodness of his heart beaming in his expressive
eye and fine countenance. Gutenberg felt
acquainted with him almost intuitively, and, in answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
to his kind inquiries, briefly related the history
of his long experiments and checkered experiences.</p>

<p>“That last lawsuit was most scandalous!” said
the Syndic; “such a thing ought not to be tolerated
in Mentz! Would that I had known of thy
trial at the time; I doubt not the case might have
been adjudged differently. I will, however, do
what I can for thee.”</p>

<p>He was as good as his word. Fully appreciating
Gutenberg’s estimable qualities, he even offered to
lend him money, again to commence in business,
and would, if desired, become a silent partner.</p>

<p>This was most welcome to Gutenberg, and he
cordially accepted his generous proposals.</p>

<p>At Friele’s suggestion, he lost no time in removing
into the mansion formerly occupied by his father,
where his brother now lived. It was a fine old
edifice, roomy, baronial, and substantial, dating back
hundreds of years. It was in no sense inferior to
the Zum Jungen; and the inventor had a comfortable
suite of family apartments, as well as convenient
printing rooms.</p>

<p>Previous to his removal, as he was making preparations
to leave, Dr. Faust called on him, and, extending
his hand, <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I owe you many apologies, master, for my unjust
treatment in the matter of the lawsuit. It
costs me an effort to admit this; but I feel that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
have injured you, and must seek to make amends.
I have been to Paris, engaged in the sale of Bibles,
and have seen your connection with the art of printing
as never before. Success has softened and removed
my prejudices; and I shall have no peace of
mind until you pardon me, and take your place in
the firm.”</p>

<p>Gutenberg was both surprised and indignant.
He had been foully wronged by Faust and Schoeffer,
and it seemed like adding insult to injury for
them so late in the day to make amends by bald
apologies. He had been too much hurt by their
unkindness to think of resuming his former position
as partner.</p>

<p>“Moreover,” urged Friele, to whom he confided
the matter, “you cannot think of accepting merely
nominal concessions. They do not frankly confess
how cruelly they have wronged you. And were
you to join the firm again without as public a confession
as the insult they gave you, you would be
wanting in self-respect. And what guarantee can
you have that they will not treat you ill a second
time? I counsel you to remove to the homestead,
where you can have ample facilities for prosecuting
your chosen employment.”</p>

<p>We can only conjecture the motives which influenced
Faust in his apologies to Gutenberg. Perhaps,
now that his pecuniary trial was over, he felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
sincerely to regret the separation from the distinguished
man who he must fain acknowledge was
the originator of the art which had brought fame
and money to himself and partner. Or it may be
that he dreaded his influence as a rival.</p>

<p>Waiving Faust’s proposal, Gutenberg hastened to
establish himself in the mansion of his ancestors.</p>

<p>In resuming printing, he found much delay from
the necessity of making everything anew. He had
irrecoverably lost the labor of years. He must
construct more presses, another set of punches, and
new type. The presses were manufactured in as
good style as those he had relinquished; but sadly
he missed the nice execution of Schoeffer in getting
up the punches and type.</p>

<p>He was, it is true, aided by two of his old office
workmen,&mdash;Martin and Hanau; but his <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">stucke</i> was
nevertheless inferior in finish to that which Schoeffer
devised. He would not, however, relinquish his
enterprise on that account, but proceeded to print
the “Balbus de Janua.”</p>

<p>“Why not print more Bibles?” asked Martin
Duttlinger in 1457, after they had issued the “Balbus
de Janua.”</p>

<p>“My Bibles are being printed by others!” replied
the inventor, sadly. “This care is taken from
me; but I have the satisfaction of knowing that it
will be done as I planned it. I selected the vellum.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
How many journeys I made to the manufacturer
to insure a good article! How I criticised and experimented
with it until I succeeded in getting a
smooth, fine texture! The ink, too, what a labor it
cost me! And the regularity of setting up the
page,&mdash;it was long before we attained it. The
cutting of the type occupied us a long time until we
found the method of casting it; and now, with the
help of punches, we can make the same elegant
type. Why should I seek to issue another edition
of the Bible, when my own is publishing? I cannot
compete as a salesman with Faust; and the present
Bible which is printing is as really my own as another
could be.”</p>

<p>“But will you not at least publish a Psalter?”</p>

<p>“Not at present,” replied Gutenberg; “this which
Faust and Schoeffer are issuing has been in press
four years. When they thrust me from the firm,
the type was in readiness, and a portion of it was
set up. Two years and a half we had lavished
skill and money upon it. This also I must consider
mainly my own, as I planned to issue it, and superintended
the work. Others reap my harvest; but
they cannot destroy the peace and satisfaction I enjoy
in the consciousness of having been the instrument
of doing good.” Thus did the truly great
man put by all selfish considerations.</p>

<p>However, he continued to print various other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
works, among which were the “Donatus,” the
“Catholicon,” “Speculum Sacerdotum,” “Celebratio
Missarum,” and others.</p>

<p>There is on record a curious deed, or grant of
property, which gives quite an inkling of his affairs
in 1459, when his brother Friele was associated with
him as a successful publisher.</p>

<p>This legal instrument is as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We, Henne (John) Gutenberg and Friele
Gutenberg, brothers, do affirm and publicly declare
by these presents, and make known to all,
that with the advice and consent of our dear cousins,
John and Friele and Perdiman Gensfleisch,
brothers, of Mentz, we have renounced and do renounce
by these presents, for us and for our heirs,
simply, totally, and at once, without fraud and deceit,
all the property which has passed by means of
our sister Hebele to the Convent of St. Claire of
Mentz, in which she has become a nun; whether
the said property has come to it on the part of our
father, Henne Gensfliesch, who gave it himself, or
in whatever manner the property may have come
to it, whether in grain, ready money, furniture,
jewels, or whatever it may be, that the respectable
nuns, the abbess and sisters of the said convent,
have received in common or individually, or other
persons of the convent, from the said Hebele, be it
little or much.... And as to the books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
which I, the said Henne (John), have given to the
library of the convent, they are to remain there
always and forever; and I, the said Henne, propose
also to give in future to the library of the said convent,
for the use of the present and future nuns, for
their religious worship, either for reading or chanting,
or in whatever manner they may wish to make
use of them according to the rules of their order,
<em>all</em> [that is, copies of <em>all</em>] <em>the books which I, the said
Henne, have printed up to this hour, or which I shall
hereafter print, in such quantities as they may wish
to make use of</em>; and for this the said abbess, the
successors, and nuns of the said Convent of St.
Claire have declared and promised to acquit me
and my heirs of the claim which my sister Hebele
had to sixty florins which I and my brother Friele
had promised to pay and deliver to the said Hebele
as her portion and share arising from the house
which Henne (John) our father assigned to him
for his share, in virtue of the writings which were
drawn up thereupon, without fraud and deceit.
And in order that this may be observed by us, and
by our heirs, steadfastly and to its full extent, we
have given the said nuns and their convent and
order these present writings, sealed with our seals.
Signed and delivered the year of the birth of J.&nbsp;C.
1459, on the day of St. Margaret.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Lamartine refers to an act of donating, made by Gutenberg
to his sister Hebele, nun in the Convent of St. Claire at Mentz,
by which he put her in possession of the religious books <em>which he
had printed at Strasbourg</em>, and made her the promise of sending her
successively all those which should issue from his press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span></p></div>

<p>Although it is evident from this deed that Gutenberg
was at this time successfully established in
printing again by means of a further division of his
father’s estate, and by the aid of his friends, yet it
also appears that his works were not remunerative.
Comparatively few books were called for,&mdash;not
only the books, but the market for them, had to be
made; and this, when we consider the competition
of such a firm as Faust and Schoeffer, was no light
affair. The worthy Syndic stood nobly by him,
and his friends were kind and appreciative, or he
had accomplished much less after the breaking up
of his favorite projects at the Zum Jungen.</p>

<p>But a sad and deeply afflictive event overtook
him, which again threw his affairs into confusion.
This was the sudden death of his beloved Anna, who
left his side with an angel’s smile and words of
triumph for the endless life. The unexpected blow
completely unnerved him for a long time; and even
when the healing hand of time soothed the wound,
he had no heart to go on with an art with which
she was so intimately associated.</p>

<p>Friele sympathized most deeply in his sorrow,
and at length advised a change of scene and occupation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
as antidotes to his grief. Accordingly he
sold out his printing materials to the Syndic, Conrad
Humery, after some eight years’ practicing of
his art in the new firm.</p>

<p>But he was not allowed to be forsaken in his old
age. From letters patent, dated January 17, 1465,
we learn that he was invited to enter the service of
the Elector Adolphus of Nassau, as one of his band
of gentlemen pensioners, with a handsome salary.
Thus did he honorably retire from the practice of
his loved art, secure in the thought that although
it had cost him much tribulation, yet it was firmly
established in doing its beneficent mission to the
world.</p>

<p>This was three years after the city of Mentz was
sacked and plundered by Count Adolphus; and
while others were broken up in their avocations and
forced to flee, he was spared from such a fate, and
was promoted to his own appropriate honorable
place in his native city.</p>

<p>Thus peacefully and in useful duties did he go
down the vale of life, until February 24, 1468, when
he quitted this earthly scene, let us trust for the
happier employments of the better world. His
death seems like the calm, unclouded setting of the
sun, after a tempestuous day.</p>

<p>Some one has said that genius, in its general
sense, is universal; a possession belonging to all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
men, in some degree. Its greatest achievement is
not in a great poem or painting, or any other work
of art, but in a great life; and the strong heart
and stout hands are its most miraculous organs.
He who, by the majestic dignity of his daily walk,
gives the beauty of truth to common life, is a great
genius,&mdash;because he illustrates and sets forth, in
its noblest form, virtue and true worth.</p>

<p>So Gutenberg, after he had done the will of God,
and had been led on to perfect the most glorious
invention under the sun, had need of patience.
The Heavenly Father would not permit so chosen
a son to become perverted by unmingled prosperity.</p>

<p>Hence he suffered him to be disappointed, and
the patient hero was evidently blessed by his trials.
He became, if never before, that which so few attain,
“commander of himself;” and this, according
to a wise author, is no small triumph. “He that
ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city.”</p>

<p>Several trying lawsuits diversified the eventful
life of Gutenberg. They were grievous and harrowing
to his sensitive feelings, but subserve a good
purpose to posterity, giving many well-authenticated
facts respecting him, which otherwise would
have been lost. Little did he think, while passing
through these fiery ordeals, that he was by them
really inscribing the deeds of his life on the scroll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
of fame. We moderns, seizing upon each item in
the law records as a choice morsel of literary history,
are prone to forget that they were made at
the sacrifice of the peace and comfort of the inventor.</p>

<p>Especially was the writ of the notary public,
summoning Gutenberg to the parlor of the Barefoot
Friars, a crushing event. It came when he was
just on the point of realizing his fondest hopes,&mdash;when
the Bible was printed, and almost ready to be
issued from the press. By this process of law, he
was under the necessity of mortgaging his printing
materials to Faust; this shows that his large private
fortune had been previously expended in experiments,
and that thus he had fallen into the clutches
of his more wealthy partner.</p>

<p>Because the great invention failed to bring in
money as soon as the firm had hoped, Faust must
needs take the law on Gutenberg, seizing his printing
materials, wrought out with so much thought
and toil. The presses, the plan of which had been
for years ripening in his brain, and to secure the
making of which cost him so much money, were no
longer his; neither was the type which he invented
at such an expense of time, effort, and money, nor
yet the illuminated letters designed under his eye.
Yes, the very initial letters used by Gutenberg and
his firm, in works executed between 1450 and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
1455, were also used by Faust and Schoeffer in the
Psalter of 1457 and 1459. After so much effort
almost in vain, what wonder if Gutenberg had become
disheartened, and yielded to despair! Far
from that. His indefatigable spirit knew no rest;
many floods could not quench the fire of his perseverance;
he started again, laid the foundations,
and successfully wrought in new printing rooms,
his Bible and his Psalter meanwhile being printed
by other hands.</p>

<p>But there were certain considerations which alleviated
the poignancy of Gutenberg’s disappointment.
He had the consolation of knowing that he
had designed the enterprise of publishing the Bible,
and that he had carried it successfully to its termination.
And now, with the magnanimity of a great
soul, he was willing that others should circulate it.
Besides, he had at times a hope that he should yet
have justice done him. It was as true then as now
that a man may be disappointed in his greatest
hopes in life, without, on that account, becoming
unhappy; for, as one has said, “There is no other
actual misfortune except this only, <em>not to have God
for our friend</em>.”</p>

<p>And this art of printing, which had been such a
trial and triumph, such a grief and a joy, was destined
to embalm his name and the memory of his
life infinitely more than if all the conquests of
world-renowned warriors were his.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">To</span> return to Faust and Schoeffer. After the
lawsuit, as we have seen, they mostly ignored
the existence and services of Gutenberg. Soon
after the memorable separation, Faust went to
Paris as before related, the sales of Bibles in Germany
alone being so limited as to bring in but small
returns for the money invested. It was evidently
necessary to take extraordinary measures to meet
the emergency. In Faust’s cool, business-like view,
everything would be lost, unless some speedy and
marked success was attained. His experiments
resulted better even than he had anticipated; and
returning flush with money, the printing rooms
soon presented a scene of unwonted activity. The
“Litterariæ Indulgentiæ,” with which Schoeffer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
his journeymen had busied themselves during
Faust’s absence, was urged through the press and
into the market.</p>

<p>“What a difference a little money makes!” said
Faust, as he saw how well the book was selling.
“We must hasten to finish the Psalter.”</p>

<p>This was ready for purchasers by August 1457.
It was in the highest style of the printing art of
the age, and could not be excelled. As Faust and
Schoeffer gazed on its beautiful pages, how could
they forget the inventor who designed the publishing
of the work, and labored with them in executing
it full thirty long painstaking months! Yet
they uttered few words of acknowledgment. For
two years they were occupied in striking off, binding,
embellishing, and selling the Psalter, with the
additional labor of casting a new fount of type.
While Schoeffer and his assistants were engaged in
this absorbing toil, Faust again visited Paris to dispose
of the Psalter. By this means he replenished,
once more, the treasury of the firm, and returning
about the time the new fount was finished, they
printed the “Durandi.”</p>

<p>The next year, 1460, the “Constitutiones” appeared,
and in 1462 a new edition of the Latin
Bible. This last was the eventful year in which
the city of Mentz was taken, sacked, and plundered
by the Elector Adolphus of Nassau. Such was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the confusion and distraction occasioned by this
unlooked-for event, that almost all business was
suspended. The journeyman printers, being suddenly
thrown out of employment, fled panic-stricken
to other countries; and considering themselves
freed from their oath, the great secret of thirty
years was spread abroad.</p>

<p>Faust and Schoeffer, left almost alone in their
printing rooms, effected little for some time. At
length Schoeffer’s busy brain hit upon something
new in printing; and with his usual patience and
assiduity he fell to casting a fount of Greek type,
and in 1465, some little time after Gutenberg had
retired from his art, issued “Cicero de Officiis,”
using the new Greek type. On occasion of printing
anything of special importance, Faust continued to
visit Paris, then the chief seat of learning; and so
great a work as this of Cicero in Greek would of
course be welcomed with avidity by the professors
and students in the University. As soon as possible,
therefore, he hastened to that city, furnished
with a good supply of the much-coveted volume.
This was early in 1466. He was received with
enthusiasm; for such had been the reputation of the
previous works circulated by him in the French
metropolis, that he had a large circle of admiring
patrons and friends. But alas for the uncertainty
of earthly things! while yet in the midst of success<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
and gratulation, he was seized with the plague, and
died after an illness of a few hours! The Parisians
were loud in their expressions of grief, and a large
concourse gathered at his funeral. The learned
men and nobility of the city assembled; distinguished
honors were paid him; and the sequel was,
that in commemoration of the signal services he
had rendered them, they continued a generous
pecuniary reward to his descendants.</p>

<p>The dreadful shock occasioned by the death of
his father-in-law, deeply affected Schoeffer. May
we not suppose that in his loneliness and affliction,
he sought a reconciliation with his old master, Gutenberg?
There is, indeed, evidence that this was
the case; and we are permitted to infer that the
breach was healed, suitable acknowledgments being
made by Schoeffer, as he plainly saw that the
mortgage act which made Faust master of Gutenberg’s
property, did not include his genius. In
later years he frankly confessed as much to Trithemius,
Abbot of Spanheim Monastery, a celebrated
scholar and author. Says this writer, after mentioning
that he had his information from the mouth
of Peter Schoeffer, the inventor of cast metal
<span class="locked">types:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“About this time that wonderful and almost
incredible art of printing and characterizing books,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
was thought of and invented by John Gutenberg, a
citizen of Mentz.”</p>

<p>Then follows some of the main particulars of the
invention on which we have already dwelt. He
also mentions that “Gutenberg spent all his substance
in quest of the art, and met with such insuperable
difficulties, that, in despair, he had nearly
given up all hopes of success, till he was assisted by
the liberality of Faust, and by his brother’s skill in
the city of Mentz.”</p>

<p>Schoeffer, having associated with him Conrad
Henliff, nobly presided over the interests of the
great art after Gutenberg’s death, diligently issuing
elegant editions of various books. His last work
was a new impression of his master’s superb Bible
in 1502, in which year he died, after laboring
thirty-five or thirty-six years as a printer. His
monogram is connected with Faust’s; and, as we
have mentioned, some suppose this also to have
been the device of Gutenberg.</p>

<p>The name of Schoeffer means shepherd; and well
did the thoughtful care, caution, and ingenuity of
this man aid in watching over the young art, that
needed such vigilant cherishing to bring it to maturity.
He was once Gutenberg’s right-hand man,
next to him in genius in devising, and, despite his
doubtful course afterwards in leaving him, was an
honor and a blessing to his country. His son John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
succeeded him in his office, and later still his grandson
John chose the same employment.</p>

<p>Of Costar, little can be said. Some even suppose
that no such person ever existed; while others
incline to confer on him honors which he never
earned. It is certain that he did not reach the
idea of movable types. He died in 1440, when
Gutenberg had been familiar with their use for
years.</p>

<p>The capture of Mentz, in 1462, was the means
of carrying the knowledge of the art of printing
to Hamburg, Cologne, Strasbourg, Augsburg, and
other cities; and in a short time books were issued
from many places. Twenty-four different works
appeared between 1460 and 1470; in the latter
year two of Faust’s workmen commenced printing
in Paris. Also, in 1470, the art was practiced in
Venice. Cennini, a goldsmith, established printing
at Florence; and so industrious were the Italians
that they printed between 1470 and 1480 twelve
hundred and ninety-seven books, two hundred and
thirty-four of which were editions of ancient authors.
Presses were also established in the Low
Countries, at Utrecht, Louraine, Basle, and at Buda
in Hungary; and, indeed, in the course of a few
years, every town of any importance possessed its
printing-office, so that books were greatly multiplied.</p>

<p>Several women of France early distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
themselves in prosecuting the art of printing.
Prominent among them was Charlotte Guillard,
1490&ndash;1540, the widow of Berthold Rambolt, who
for fifty years kept several presses at work, and
printed a great number of large and very correct
editions, both in Latin and Greek. Her best impressions
were issued after she became a widow
the second time,&mdash;the Bible, the Fathers, and the
works of St. Gregory in two volumes, which were
so accurate as to contain only three faults. In
brief, her fame as a printer was so extensively
known that the learned Lewis Lippeman, Bishop
of Verona, selected her to print his “Catena in
Genesim.” With the accomplishment of this, he
was so well satisfied, that, after assisting at the
Council of Trent, he went on purpose to Paris to
return thanks to her, and also gave her his second
volume to print, the “Catena in Exodum,” which
she performed with like precision and elegance.</p>

<p>Elfield was more especially noted for its productions
in printing, since Henry and Nicholas Becktermange,
successors of Gutenberg, there wrought
at his presses and other printing apparatus, which
were the latest efforts in the art. Says Dibdin,
“The works of these men are greatly sought after
by the curious, as they afford much proof by collation
of the genuineness of the works attributed to
their great predecessor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
The first English printer was William Caxton,
mercer, or merchant, who became acquainted with
the art while engaged in mercantile pursuits in
Germany. Returning to England, he established
the printing-press at Westminster Abbey, in 1480.
Although somewhat advanced in years when he commenced,
yet such was his industry and perseverance
that he translated and printed, in ten years, no
less than twenty-five octavo volumes. These were
mostly useful literary and religious works, but did
not indicate high culture in England. The last
work he issued, and on which he was engaged
when overtaken by death, was “The Art and Craft
to know well how to Die.”</p>

<p>After the death of Caxton, Wynken de Worde,
his partner, continued to print in his office, living
in his house at Westminster, and styling himself
“Printer to Margaret, etc., the King’s Grandame.”
He printed the Acts of Parliament with the Royal
Arms, also many Latin and English books; in forty
years over four hundred volumes.</p>

<p>It is not known that he printed any Greek works,
yet he made many improvements in the art of printing.
His first care was to cut a new set of punches;
he sunk these into matrices, and cast several sorts
of printing letters, afterwards used in his books.
He was the first English printer who introduced the
Roman letter into England, using it to mark striking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
thoughts. His type was remarkable for its precision,
and for a long time was not excelled.</p>

<div id="ip_214" class="figcenter" style="width: 197px;">
  <img src="images/i_214.jpg" width="197" height="139" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="bold">Wynken·de·Worde</span></div></div>

<p>The art of printing was not long in extending to
other places in England besides London. It was
started in Oxford in 1480, also at St. Albans in the
same year, and many other places, among which
were York, Canterbury, Worcester, Ipswich, and
Norwich. The “Common Prayer” was printed in
Dublin by Humphrey Powell, in quarto, black letter,
in 1551. Before and after that period the authors
of Ireland had their works printed abroad.</p>

<p>“Euclid’s Geometry,” the first work in Latin
printed with diagrams, was issued from the press of
Randolt, at Venice, 1482. Aldus also printed the
works of Virgil there, in Italic types, in 1501, the
first attempt at producing cheap books.</p>

<p>Blaeu, who assisted Tycho Brahe in making his
mathematical instruments, effected great improvements
in the printing-press. He made nine presses,
and named them after the nine Muses. His fame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
soon reached England, where his excellent printing
machines were soon after introduced.</p>

<p>Aldus Manutius, of Venice, during a career of
twenty-six years in the employment of printing,
produced editions of nearly all the Greek and Roman
authors then known to exist. He was also the
author of several works of learning,&mdash;grammars
and dictionaries of the Greek and Latin languages,
the last forming a folio volume, the first that had
ever been prepared.</p>

<p>For nearly one hundred and fifty years the Estiennes
of France were famous as printers. Robert
Stephens, a member of this family, was the first inventor
of the verses into which the New Testament
is now divided, and introduced them in his edition
of it published in 1551. Harry, the eldest son of
Robert Stephens, was one of the most learned men
of his time. “Thesaurus,” a dictionary of the
Greek language, was the fruit of twelve years’ hard
application of the elder Stephens, who also suffered
persecution for being a Protestant, and fled from
France to reside at Geneva. The early printers
were well educated; but time and space fail us to
note the many learned men who practiced the art in
different countries, who, availing themselves of the
new sources of information, added to the general
stock of knowledge as they eagerly grasped the
shining treasures laid open by the discovery of
printing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
It is well known that the first printers were
learned; and, being engaged in printing from ancient
and classical manuscripts, were naturally the
associates of the first literary characters of the age.
Indeed, in the infancy of printing, and long afterwards,
the occupation was very honorable, and was
only engaged in by well-educated persons. It was
the glory of the learned to be known as correctors
of the press to literary printers; physicians, lawyers,
bishops, and even popes themselves occupied
this department; and a distinguished name, as corrector
of the press, being given in a work, it was
far more highly valued.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">On</span> inquiring more closely respecting the peculiarities
of the first printed books and the modes
of producing them, we find that they were generally
large or small folios or quartos; lesser sizes than
these not being in use. In some cases they had no
title, number of pages, or paragraph divisions. The
character employed was designed to imitate the
hand-writing of the time, a rude old Gothic or German,
from which the old English was formed, now
known as German text. The words were printed
so closely together as to make reading difficult even
by those accustomed to it, while one unpracticed
got on slowly and with many blunders.</p>

<p>The orthography used in the first books was of
almost every variety, defying method. Abbreviations
were fashionable, and at length became so numerous
and so difficult to be understood that a book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
or key was published, explaining them. Instead of
a comma an oblique stroke was employed. Capital
letters were not used to begin a sentence, or for
proper names. Blanks were left for the places of
titles, initial letters, and other ornaments, in order
to have them supplied by illuminators, whose curious
art, however, soon gave place to the improvements
of the printers. The ornaments made by
the old artists to fill the blanks were formed with
singular taste; birds, beasts, flowers, and foliage
often curiously interwoven with the most desirable
colors, and even with gold and silver. Saints were
sometimes made to figure in the border of illuminated
letters, whether the subject treated required
it or not. The artist had no regard to the theme
of the author in his adornments. These embellishments
were sometimes costly and elaborate; but a
cheaper kind could be had. Bibles and Breviaries
were most elegantly ornamented.</p>

<p>The name of the printer and his place of residence
were either omitted, or placed at the end of
the book with some pious ejaculation or doxology.
There was no date, or it appeared in some odd place,
printed in words perhaps, or by numerical letters,
and sometimes partly one and partly the other,
thus: “One thousand CCCC. and LXXIII.,” but
in all cases at the end of a book. The Roman and
Italic letters not being invented, the pages were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
uniformly Gothic through the book. Only a few
copies were issued at once; two hundred was a
large impression.</p>

<p>The early printer was of necessity also a bookbinder,
placing his leaves literally between <em>boards</em>,
and making some works so heavy as to provoke the
criticism, “No man can carry them about, much
less get them into his head.” About 1469&ndash;70,
alphabetical tables of the first words of each chapter
were introduced as a guide to the binder.</p>

<p>After the great secret of printing was spread
abroad, the early printers, in their own quaint style,
took pains to inform the public that the book they
issued was printed.</p>

<p>Caxton said of his first book, “It is not written
with pen and ink as other books be, to the end that
every man may have them at once; for all the
books of this story, thus imprinted as ye here see,
were begun in one day, and also finished in one
day;” that is, the edition.</p>

<p>The Mentz printers, at the end of each of their
first works, made it known that instead of being
drawn or written with a pen, they were made by
a new art and invention of printing or stamping
them by characters or types of metal set in forms.</p>

<p>King Henry VI. was moved by the Archbishop
of Canterbury to use all possible means for procuring
a printing mould, as it was then called, to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
brought into England. It is supposed that Caxton,
after the custom in other monasteries, set up his
press near one of the aisles of Westminster Abbey.
The first book printed there was “The Game of
Chess,” a work then much used by all classes of
people, and “doubtless desired by the Abbot, and
the rest of his friends and masters.” Caxton translated
it from the Latin of a Dominican friar, who
wrote it in the year 1200. It was in the main a good
book, else Caxton, with his decided religious principle,
would not have published it; he recommends it
as “full of wholesome wisdom, and requisite unto
every state and degree.” But to us it seems a curious
mingling of amusement and advice. There
were instructions for playing the game, side by side
with counsels which, according to Caxton, would
enable the people to understand wisdom and virtue.</p>

<p>The course of study then comprised in what
was thought a good education, was very limited.
Teacher and pupil in most cases attempted little,
and accomplished little. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">trivium</i> and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quadrivium</i>
were the two branches of what was then
understood as the liberal arts. The former included
grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics; the latter, music,
arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy. It was
thought that he who became master of these studies
needed no longer a preceptor or assistance in solving
any questions within the compass of human
reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
But thorough students in these branches were
seldom found, until the dissemination of books by
the art of printing gave a new impetus to the intellect
of that age.</p>

<p>Interesting it has been to trace step by step the
passing on of this art to perfection. Long were
genius and industry engaged in its study, and never
was there so rich and glorious a harvest from human
efforts. The nurse and preserver of the arts
and sciences, of religion and civilization, was not the
work of one brain solely, neither did the gift bring
peace at once, but rather strife and opposition. Ignorance
fled before it as darkness from light; the
priests and copyists were disturbed; and the way
was made ready for the bringing in of the Reformation,
commencing in 1517 under Martin Luther.
For doubtless the invention of this art did more to
unmask the superstitions of the Papal church than
all other causes combined.</p>

<p>Gutenberg’s conception and execution of printing
the Bible was a magnificent enterprise;
through unparalleled difficulties, he produced an
eloquent and superb book, which is even now
the admiration of the learned. We scarcely know
which most to admire, the great art, or the noble
purpose to which its incalculable power was lent.
His praise is in every land, but most of all do his
countrymen love and revere his memory. Statues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of Gutenberg have been erected in several cities
of Germany, and festival occasions celebrating his
achievements are frequent. A picture of one of
these days of grateful rejoicing is the following account
of a</p>

<h3>CELEBRATION AT MENTZ.</h3>

<p>“The modes in which a large population displays
its enthusiasm are pretty much the same throughout
the world. If the sentiment which collects
men together be very heart-stirring, it will be seen
in the outward manifestations. Thus processions,
orations, public dinners, and pageantries, which in
themselves are vain and empty, are important when
the persons whom they collect together are moved
by one common feeling, which sways them for the
time.</p>

<p>“We never saw such a popular fervor as prevailed at
Mentz, at the festival of August 1857. The statue
was to be uncovered on Monday the 14th; but on
Sunday evening the name of Gutenberg was rife
through the streets. In the morning, all Mentz was
in motion by six o’clock; and at eight, a procession
was formed to the Cathedral, which, if it was not
much more imposing than some of the processions
of trades in London and other cities, was conducted
with a quiet precision which evinced that the people
felt that they were engaged in a solemn act.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
The fine old Cathedral was crowded; the Bishop
of Mentz performed High Mass; the first Bible
printed by Gutenberg was displayed. What a
field for reflection was here opened! The first
Bible in connection with the imposing pageantries
of Roman Catholicism,&mdash;the Bible in great part a
sealed book to the body of the people; the service
of God in a tongue unknown to the larger number
of worshippers; but that first Bible the germ of
millions of Bibles that have spread the light of
Christ throughout the veritable globe!</p>

<p>“The mass ended, the procession again advanced
to an adjacent square, where the statue was to be
opened. Here was erected a vast amphitheatre,
where, seated under their respective banners, were
deputations from all the great cities of Europe.
Amidst salvos of artillery the veil was removed
from the statue, and a hymn sung by a thousand
voices. Then came orations, then dinners, balls,
orations, boat-races, processions by torch light.
For three days the population of Mentz was kept
in a state of high excitement, the echo of which
went through Germany, and “Gutenberg! Gutenberg!”
was toasted in many a bumper of Rhenish
wine amidst this cordial and enthusiastic people.</p>

<p>“And, indeed, even in one who could not boast of
belonging to the land in which printing was invented,
the universal and mighty effects of this art,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
when rightly considered, would produce almost a
corresponding enthusiasm. It is difficult to look
upon the great changes that have been effected during
the last four centuries, and which are still in
progress everywhere around us, and not connect
them with printing and its inventor. The castles
on the Rhine, under whose ruins we travelled back
from Mentz, perished before the powerful combinations
of the people of the towns. The petty feudal
despots fell when the burghers had acquired wealth
and knowledge. But the progress of despotism on
a larger scale could not have been arrested, had the
art of Gutenberg not been discovered. The strongholds
of military power still frown over the same
majestic river. The Rhine has seen its petty fortresses
crumble into decay. Ehrenbreitstein is
stronger than ever. But even Ehrenbreitstein will
fall before the powers of the mind. Seeing, then,
what, under God, intellect has done and is doing,
we may well venerate the memory of Gutenberg
of Mentz.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Let</span> us now glance at the Art of Printing in
modern times.</p>

<p>In the making of types, formerly each letter was
cast, and then finished one at a time, by hand.
Now there is a process of manufacturing the copper
face by machinery, the operation being effected by
the pressure of a sharp die upon copper. And it
is said that a small steam-engine can produce one
type a second, or thirty-six thousand in ten hours.</p>

<p>By the more ordinary process, types are made
by casting type-metal in a mould, though some of
the larger sizes are manufactured from maple, mahogany,
or box-wood. The process of casting type,
which is the business of the type-founders, requires
great skill. In the first place, a punch is
cut, of the letter to be formed, except that it is in
reverse. The punch being of hardened steel, and
having this letter on its point, is then struck into a
small piece of copper, which is called the <em>matrix</em>, or
form of the letter to be cast. The matrix is now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
fixed in a curiously contrived instrument, termed
the mould, attached to a compact hand machine,
having in the centre a small furnace of burning coal
to keep the vessel of type-metal over it liquid. The
workman turns a wheel, thus forcing melted metal
into the mould, which quickly shapes and drops one
after another the types, perfect, save polishing. In
some foundries there are twenty of these machines.
In this way not only every letter, but every figure,
hyphen, comma, or other mark, must have its punch
and matrix, as well as its separate casting. One
machine will cast one hundred types a minute.</p>

  <img src="images/i_226.jpg" width="80" height="182" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Metal Type.</div></div>

<p>In the cut, <em>a</em> is the body; <em>b</em>, the face,
or part from which the impression is
taken; <em>c</em>, the shoulder, or top of the
body; <em>d</em>, the nick, designed to assist the
compositor in distinguishing the bottom of
the face from the top; and <em>e</em>, the groove
made in the process of finishing.</p>

<p>As soon as a heap of types is cast, a boy takes
them away, and breaks off the superfluous piece at
the end of each, when another rubs its sides on a
stone, to render it smooth. The face, or printing
part of the type, is not touched after it leaves the
matrix, that giving it all the distinctness and sharpness
of which it is capable.</p>

<p>Type-metal is a compound of lead and antimony,
in the proportion of three to one, with a small
portion of tin, and sometimes a little copper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
In Gutenberg’s day types were necessarily an
imitation of the handwriting of the monk-copyists,
with little variety and beauty. Now the types
which compose an ordinary book-fount consist of
Roman CAPITALS, <span class="smcap">small capitals</span>, and lower-case
letters, and <em>Italic capitals</em> and lower-case letters,
with accompanying figures, points and reference-marks,&mdash;in
all about two hundred characters.
Including the various modern styles of fancy types,
some three or four hundred varieties of face are
made. Besides the ordinary Roman and <em>Italic</em>, the
most important of the varieties are</p>

Until a comparatively recent period, no better
method of inking the type had been devised than
Gutenberg’s sheep-skin dabbers, or stamping balls.
Earl Stanhope, who greatly improved the printing-press,
sought by many experiments to supply the
ink by means of a revolving cylinder or roller, instead
of by the old process. The first impediment
was the seam which it was necessary to make down
the whole length of the roller; and it could be kept
neither soft nor pliable. Providentially these difficulties
were overcome by observing a process in
the Staffordshire potteries, in which the workmen
use what are there called dabbers. These dabbers,
composed of glue and treacle, possessed every requisite
to hold and distribute the ink, spreading it
evenly over the form, besides being easily kept
clean and pliable. This method was at once seized
upon by ingenious printers, who used it in time in
the cylinder form, as is common now in all printing-offices.</p>

<p>Formerly, the word <em>the</em> was indicated by the
letters <em>y</em> and <em>e</em>, thus&mdash;<em>y<sup>e</sup></em>; <em>&amp;</em> was used for <em>and</em>;
with other ungainly abbreviations. Connected letters
were also employed; <em>c</em> and <em>t</em> were joined by a
curve from the top of one to the other; and when
two <em>s’s</em> occurred a long <em>ſ</em> was used.</p>

  <div class="caption">COMPOSITION ROOM.</div></div>

<p>Instead of ponderous folios and quartos, untitled,
unpaged, and unparagraphed; without capitals, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
with words so huddled together as to put the reader
to his wit’s end to make out the meaning, now we
have the beautiful pocket and library editions, convenient
in size, clear and intelligible within,&mdash;“books
that you may carry to the fire and hold
readily in your hand,” as Dr. Johnson says.</p>

<p>We have, in imagination, visited Gutenberg’s
Printing Rooms, and can vividly recall his rude beginnings
and slow and toilsome methods; his printing-press;
the wonder of that age,&mdash;only turning
off a few hundred impressions per diem. With this
in mind, let us step into a representative printing
establishment of our times,&mdash;the “Riverside,” at
Cambridge, Mass.; for we wish to get a just idea
of the Art of arts. We will first visit the Composition
Room.</p>

<p>Ranged down the sides of the room we see scores
of laborers industriously at work, each one before a
stand or frame, in shape similar to the music-stand
at an orchestra. Each frame is constructed
so as to hold two pairs of cases, one containing
the Roman, the other the Italic letters of the same
“fount,” or kind. The upper case has ninety-eight
little divisions for the different kinds of type;
the lower case has fifty-four boxes, arranged as in
the diagram on the opposite page. The “compositor”
or “type-setter,” is said to “work at case;”
for all the types are sorted in “cases,” or shallow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
open and divided boxes; the lower case, or the one
nearest him, having all the small letters, points, and
spaces to place between the words, and the upper
case containing all capitals, accented letters, figures,
and characters used as references to notes. Each
letter has a larger or smaller box appropriated to
it, according as it is seldom or frequently required,
while the letters most needed occupy the position
most convenient for the compositor.</p>

<p>In the English language, the letter <em>e</em> inhabits
the largest box; <em>a</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>i</em>, <em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>o</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>u</em>, live
in the next-sized apartments; <em>b</em>, <em>f</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>l</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>v</em>, <em>w</em>, <em>y</em>,
dwell in what may be called the bed-rooms; while
<em>j</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>æ</em>, and <em>œ</em>, double letters, etc., are more
humbly lodged in cupboards, garrets, and cellars,
as we call the various compartments of the case.
The reason of this arrangement is, that the letter <em>e</em>
being visited by the compositor sixty times as often
as <em>z</em>,&mdash;his hand spending an hour in the former
box for every minute in the latter,&mdash;it is advisable
that the letters oftenest required should be in the
nearest and largest boxes; everything being systematized
so as to secure accuracy and despatch.</p>

<p>PLAN OF LOWER CASE.</p></div></div>

<p>Behold the busy company. Eyes, fingers, and
arms move almost in every direction with steadiness
and speed. Some are “distributing;” that
is, filling their cases with letters from the type
pages of books or papers which have been printed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
off. This is done with great celerity; the compositor
grasps and reads several sentences at once;
and without again looking at the letters, his nimbly
flying fingers deposit them, one by one, here, there,
everywhere, in the square dens to which they belong.
Four thousand “ems” per hour can thus be
distributed by a good compositor, which is about
five times as many as he can “compose,” or set
in type; as it is much easier to spend money than
to earn it.</p>

<p>Having filled the cases, the workman is ready to
“compose.” Standing in front of the cases which
contain the Roman letters, and having placed the
“copy,” or manuscript from which he is to set,
upon the least used part of the upper case, he takes
in his left hand the “composing-stick,” made of
brass or iron, with a movable side which can be
adapted to any width of line by means of a
screw. He then commences putting the letters of
each word of the copy, with the necessary points
and spaces, into the stick, the thumb of his left
hand meanwhile securing each addition, from left
to right along the line. To facilitate the process, a
thin slip of brass, called the “composing-rule,” is
placed in the composing-stick at the outset, and
pulled out and put on the front of a line when completed.
When the stick is full of lines, the compositor,
with the fingers of both hands, lifts them out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
as if they were a mass of solid metal, and places
them in the “galley,”&mdash;a flat board or piece of
zinc or brass, having a ledge at the head, and on
one or both sides. To do this last successfully requires
practice and skill. And the young printer,
although no adept in pastry-making, learns, to his
disgust, that there is nothing easier than to make
“pi,” as the heap of jumbled type, which has
slipped through his untrained fingers, is termed.</p>

<p>The galley having been filled by the contents
of successive sticks, and the requisite number of
pages to form a sheet being completed, they are arranged
upon a bench or “imposing stone,” and
surrounded with pieces of wood, or “furniture,” so
as to give a suitable margin for each page. The
whole being then secured in the “chase,” or iron
frame, by means of strips of wood and wedges.
This is called “imposing.”</p>

<p>Next, a “proof” is taken by impressing paper
upon the type, that the compositor may see and correct
the mistakes he may have made in putting the
copy into type.</p>

<p>Referring again to the engraving, “Composition
room,” in the open space are the “imposing
stones,” or “tables,” on which matter in type is
placed in order to arrange it for printing; proofs
are taken, errors corrected, and the “form” finally
made ready for the press.</p>

<p>But in this cozy, well-lighted room, sits one
whose attitude is the picture of careworn and earnest
attention. No matter what the din in the
building around him, his faculties are concentrated
on the pages of proof. It is one of the proof-readers,&mdash;and
an assistant who reads the copy,
whose office it is to see that the work goes forth
to the public correct in literary and mechanical
execution. His is a wearisome and responsible
task. His eye, with lynx-like vigilance and microscopic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
power, must detect the minutest defects
of press or author. Faults in punctuation, grammar,
rhetoric, logic, and data he must point out.
All this at a glance, in an establishment crowded
with work.</p>

<p>Type-setting by Machinery.&mdash;Its Practicability.&mdash;Various Machines
devised.&mdash;The Brown Type-setter and Distributer described.&mdash;Simplicity.&mdash;Reliability.&mdash;Speed.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the last chapter we described type-setting by
hand. Let us now for a few moments look at
the method of doing this by machinery. This is
the last achievement of that inventive enterprise
which we have seen to be so efficient in all the history
of the art; and it deserves some mention here,
both for what it already is, and for what it so confidently
promises. On witnessing this most interesting
and curious operation, one wonders, first, that
such a work, apparently requiring the constant exercise
of mind and intelligence, can be so rapidly
and perfectly done by machinery; and then, observing
the simplicity of the instruments and the
certainty of their work, one wonders again that it
has never been done before.</p>

<p>It is our aim in this history to illustrate the
prominence machinery has held in the several departments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
of the art, and how much our literature
and books owe to its aid; and it is remarkable that
this work of setting and distributing types is the
only branch of the printer’s art which has not yet
received its share of aid from labor-saving expedients.
When we consider the great improvement
which has been made in presses within the past few
years, whereby the number of impressions is multiplied
from 250 to nearly 30,000 per hour, and
when, on the other hand, we consider that in the
department of type-setting these four hundred
years have brought no advance or improvement,
but that this work is done in precisely the same
slow manner in which the inventor of movable
types first ranged them into line in the fifteenth
century, it is strongly suggested that the contributions
of genius have not been altogether impartial
and just, and that here remains a great field of inventive
enterprise as yet uncultivated. And when
it is further considered that in the estimate of our
most extensive publishers full half the present cost
of our books and periodicals is in the labor of setting
the types, the question urges itself, How has it
happened that this important branch of human industry
has been so overlooked by inventive genius?
Is there any inherent difficulty which makes it impossible
to do the work of type-setting by mechanical
appliances? The wonderful adaptation of machinery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
to all other forms of human labor and service
suggests antecedently that it must be possible
also here. Led by this faith in the possibility of
the thing, and urged by the actual necessity of doing
something to expedite this branch of the work,
many inventors have of late years been studying
upon this problem. But the mechanical type-setter
is essentially a modern invention: it is the contribution
of this age to the art. About twenty years
cover the whole period of these efforts. It seems
to be a law of human progress that a number of
failures must precede the successful effort, every
failure contributing its quota to the ultimate success,
either through its suggestions of a better way,
or by serving as a warning and indication how <em>not</em>
to do it.</p>

<p>Several type-setting machines have been devised,
some of them very ingenious; but one after another
failed to stand the test of actual work. It is
not, however, half so strange that many should fail
as that any should succeed in so great and delicate
a work. So vast and difficult is the problem, that
many of the best mechanicians of our day, whose
knowledge of the capabilities of machinery gives
their judgment peculiar weight, have pronounced
it an impossibility, and have classed these efforts
with the fascinating but visionary chase after a
method of perpetual motion. But inventors are a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
peculiar race, as is seen in the case of Gutenberg,
especially endowed with an indomitable faith in the
possible; and they are continually attempting and
doing things with little other apparent motive than
the fact that the world has supposed them impossible.</p>

<p>The inventor of the machines we have examined,
Mr. O.&nbsp;L. Brown, of Boston, has made a
careful study of the subject for years, and seems
finally to have found the secret, both of simplicity
and success. Especially is the device for setting
the types so simple that it might perhaps more
properly be called an instrument than a machine.
The Type-distributer strikes one as more curious
and wonderful, inasmuch as it is entirely automatic,
and is operated by steam; but it is an adaptation
of one of the most common and familiar mechanical
principles.</p>

<p>The Type-setter comprises a case, a stick, and
a justifier. The case consists of a series of
grooves or channels ranged side by side, each just
wide enough to receive a line of type. There is no
limit to this case, either in the number of channels,
or their length. In these channels, the types stand
upon their feet, and the case is set at such an angle
that they slide downward by their own gravity,
and rest upon the bar which closes the lower ends.
Across the foot a shield is placed, provided with
openings for the types to pass through as they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
set; and an index, showing the letters and sorts
which the case contains. Corresponding openings
in the rear allow the tongue, which forces out the
letter, to enter.</p>

<p>Below and in front of the case, sliding back and
forth upon a track at the will of the operator, is the
stick, or mechanical hand, which takes the letters
from the case. The stick consists of a semicircular
groove for receiving the type, and a lever or
key for operating it. The uppermost end of the
stick forms an indicator, pointing to the index upon
the shield. The key is provided at one end with a
tongue, or plunger, for lifting the type, and the
other forms a handle for working it. The whole
weighing but a few ounces, it is moved with the
greatest ease from letter to letter. The operator,
seizing the handle with the thumb and finger, runs
it nearly opposite the letter to be taken. It is so
arranged with an adjusting gauge that no greater
accuracy of stroke is required than in playing a
piano. As the handle of the key is depressed, a
type is thrust out into the stick. As the handle is
raised again, a “follower” pushes the type just
lifted sufficiently down the channel to allow the
next one to be taken in the same way. This operation
is repeated till the stick is full, when it is
run to one end of the track, and the line slipped
into the justifier. The stick is then ready for another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
line; and, when several are set, they are
justified by hand.</p>

<p>In all machines that have heretofore been produced,
use has been made of a set of keys to take
the letters from the case; and at first thought these
would seem to have an advantage over this with its
single key. But experience has proved it otherwise;
for the object is not merely to take the letters
from the case, but also to form them into line;
and this last has hitherto proved the most difficult
and expensive part of the work. A case capable
of holding one hundred and fifty lines of type the
size of this in which this book is printed is about
thirty inches in length; and when one letter is
taken from one end of the case and the next from
the other end, the difficult thing is to bring them
together into line quickly, surely, and with perfect
safety. It will readily be seen that in this passage
there is likely to be loss of time, and the types are
liable to misplacement, and, in the case of the more
delicate, to breakage. That nothing is gained by
multiplying the keys, will at once be seen when it
is considered that the keys, however many there
may be, must be struck singly, and time allowed
for disposing of each letter as it is indicated. The
operation of type-setting is not like that of playing
the piano, where several keys are struck simultaneously;
but, on the contrary, care must be taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
not to touch more than one at a time. In short,
that nothing is gained, but much is lost, by this
multiplicity of the keys, becomes apparent when
we consider the complication which it involves.
The machine we have seen in operation contains
one hundred and fifty letters, and uses but one key;
and this key is of the simplest construction. The
motion of the key which lifts the letter puts it also
in its place in the line. If stationary keys were employed,
a key would be required for each letter,
which would increase the first cost a hundred and
fifty times, and the liability to get out of order in
the same ratio, besides making a machine more difficult
to learn, and without increasing the speed.
But the advantages of the single key are found to
be many besides its simplicity and cheapness. It
allows the use of any number of different characters,
it is not liable to get out of order, its parts are
all in plain sight, and it is limited in speed only by
the skill of the operator. One of its greatest advantages
is that the line of type being set is always
before the eye of the compositor. He is constantly
observing the process of its formation; and there is
therefore no occasion for the “outs” and “doublets”
that are so frequently made in the machines
that carry the line away from the operator’s sight.</p>

<p>This Type-setter was brought to perfection several
years ago; but the necessity of a distributing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
machine was soon realized. In the setting of types
by machinery, it is needful that they be ranged in
lines, instead of being laid in boxes, as for hand-composition.
To do this by the slow process of
hand-distribution would more than counterbalance
the time gained by the setter. It was first attempted
to employ cheap labor for the work; but
this was not satisfactory, and was soon abandoned.
For the full utility of the setter, therefore, some
method of distribution is imperative. Consequently
Mr. Brown sought among the distributers
already projected by other inventors something that
might be adapted to accompany his setter. But a
careful examination of everything that had as yet
been produced found nothing that promised to be
satisfactory; and he turned his attention to the
only remaining expedient, namely, to create a new
one. After five years of study and labor, he produced
a distributer which, for simplicity of design
and reliability of action, is a fit complement and
companion for the setter.</p>

<p>The Type-distributer consists of a rotating ring,
about ten inches in diameter. At regular intervals
in the edge of the ring are recesses for holding
the types while being carried to their places. Radiating
from this ring are the channels into which
the types are distributed; and which, when full,
are transferred to the setter, and constitute a part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
of the case. At one side is a galley, which receives
the page to be distributed. From the galley, the
machine takes one line at a time, and lifts it into a
channel, in which it is fed towards the distributing-ring,
but a little below. From the inner end of
this line the types are lifted one at a time, and enter
the distributing-ring. This ring has an intermittent
motion, and each motion brings one of the
recesses directly over the line. One after another
the types are forced up into these recesses. A recess
is large enough to receive the largest type, and
is formed by cutting a larger slot in the ring, and
inserting a set of levers. The levers are simply
straight pieces of sheet brass or steel about two
inches long, with a hole near one end, through
which the pin passes on which they turn. These
levers, placed one upon the other in sets of six or
more, form one side of the recess. A slide or
ejector, which forces out the letter when it arrives
at its proper place, forms the back of the recess.
When a letter is fed into the ring, it stands in this
recess, and any nick that may have been made in
the edge of the type will be opposite one of the
levers. As the short arms of these levers shut
against the edge of the type, some of them entering
the nicks, the long arms take a corresponding position.
It will be seen that a slight variation in the
position of the short arms gives a much greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
variation in the long arms. The relative position of
these long arms, acting in connection with the keys,
determines where the type shall be ejected. These
keys slide out and in, and each motion of the ring
brings each set of the levers successively in front of
each key. The keys all advance a short distance,
and try the ends of the levers; and, wherever the
shape of the keys corresponds to the position of the
levers, the key advances farther, and, acting upon
the ejector, forces out the letter. The operation
is on the same principle as the common lever-lock;
the levers with the type forming a certain combination
which will move around until it arrives opposite
its own key. The lock will then be unlocked,
and the letter forced out. The keys are the slides,
which are placed in the stationary part of the machine,
inside the rotating ring, and radiating from
the centre.</p>

<p>The type are placed in the machine just as they
come from the press, the galley being adjustable to
any size of page; and any letters that the machine
cannot distribute are simply transferred to the
“pi-line,” where they stand in regular order, and
can be distributed by another machine or by hand.
The type used is the common type cast at our
foundries, as described on page 225. For the setting-machine
no change is made, but for the distributer,
this being automatic, it is prepared by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
simple system of nicks in the back of the letter.
These nicks are added very quickly and cheaply;
but this necessity will soon be obviated, as the
foundries are already making matrices or moulds
for casting founts of type containing the distributing-nick.</p>

<p>The question which will doubtless decide the
fate of this and all other machines for the purpose
is the question of speed.</p>

<p>The machines we have described, notwithstanding
their newness and the necessary inexperience
of the operators, make an economy of more than
fifty per cent. in the time of doing a given amount
of work. The distributer, being run by steam and
tended by a boy, does the work of several men.
This is a great gain; twenty-five per cent. has
been thought an amount very desirable to be
reached. It seems, too, that skill in operating the
setter is easily acquired.</p>

<p>As an illustration of this, may be given the case
of a young girl who had never seen the inside of a
printing-office, and who was induced to try the new
machine. She was initiated into the ready use
of the type-setter in five minutes’ instruction.
Seizing the mechanical hand, which takes the letters
one by one as rapidly as thought can spell
from the groove-like case, in the first hour, with
the rapid click, click, of the new-found “key,” she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
set very correctly six hundred ems, and in the second
hour accomplished the task of a thousand ems.</p>

<p>An office boy was as successful. After a few
hours’ acquaintance with the machine, it is common
for mere children, in dispatch and correctness of
execution, to rival workmen who have had long
experience in type-setting by hand.</p>

<p>The setter has been operated in competition
with two superior compositors of many years’ practice,
and has done more work than both, on fair
and equal terms. Such being the results in the
present condition of the machinery, it is only just
to conclude that this is an invention which not only
does honor to the art, and is an important step
in its progress, but must contribute materially to
the cheapening of books and the dissemination of
literature, and so serve the highest interests of
human life.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> invention of stereotyping is also a great
improvement in printing. Almost all works,
after being put in type, are stereotyped; the advantage
is that a new edition can be struck off as often
as called for, without the labor of resetting the type.</p>

<p>The process of stereotyping differs from common
printing, in that the letters, after being set up, are
cast in plates of entire pages, from plaster of Paris
moulds.</p>

<p>The workman in the picture is about removing
the moulds from the type beneath. The mould,
forming a perfect <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fac simile</i> of the page intended
to be printed, is placed with others in a great oven,
where it is dried and baked hard. The edge of
the oven can be seen at the right of the picture on
the following page, which represents the interior of
the Stereotype Foundery.</p>

<div id="ip_247b" class="figcenter" style="width: 284px;">
  <img src="images/i_248.jpg" width="284" height="340" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Moulding in Plaster.</div></div>

<p>While the plaster mould is baking in the oven,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
the foundery man is getting things in readiness for
converting it into lead. Upon the left, in the picture,
is a high pile of bars of lead, looking like an
irregular chimney. When the bars of lead are put
into the cauldron to melt, a certain amount of antimony
is put in also, to render it brittle, and tin is
added to give a brightness of surface. When the
lead, antimony, and tin are well melted, and the
scum has been removed, the composition is
poured into iron moulds, where it hardens, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
comes out in the shape of the lead that was
put into the kettle in the first place. These bars
of composition, lead being by far the largest material,
are put into the boiler over which you see the
man working, and melted again, making a molten
mass, which is kept liquid by the hot fire beneath
and the frequent stirring. When the plaster pages,
or moulds, are well baked in the oven, they are
ready to be plunged in their lead bath. An iron
pan about two feet long, a foot broad, and two or
three inches deep, is the vessel, in which is laid a
false bottom of iron, called a floater; on this are
laid the plaster moulds, face down, and the whole
is covered with an iron slab, which does not, however,
rest on the plaster moulds, but upon the edge
of the iron pan. An iron handle, like that of a
basket, is secured to the middle of the pan upon
the wooden stand in front of the picture. A crane
overhangs the boiler, and from it drops a hook surrounded
by four legs; the hook takes hold of the
hole in the handle, and the four legs press upon the
iron cover of the pan; the crane swings round,
holds the iron pan with its plaster moulds snugly
shut up in it, and suspends the body over molten
lead, lowering it until it is partly sunken in the lead
but not wholly plunged in it.</p>

<p>The four corners of the pan are not square; and
as the iron cover does not fit into the grooves, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
is access to the interior of the pan by this means.
Down them, then, the founder pours the lead, dipping
it from the boiler, until it fills up completely
all the little type openings in the plaster moulds.
Then the crane lifts it and swings it over to the
trough by which the boy is standing. It is lowered
into the water to cool, after which a crane swings
it over to the wooden standard, where one is waiting
to be opened. The handle is removed, and
then the founder, taking a heavy hammer, knocks
off the lead at the corners and edges, where it has
sealed up the iron lid on the pan. The cover is
removed, and the contents of the pan taken out.
The plaster is chipped off and thrown away; but
now are seen lead plates of the size of the plaster
moulds, having their surface raised in letters, just as
that of the moulds was sunken in letters. The
plates are about double the thickness of the slates
used in schools.</p>

<p>These plates are cooled, and washed free of plaster
in the trough,&mdash;the boy in the picture is now doing
this,&mdash;when they are ready to go into the finishing
room, to be trimmed, planed, picked out, corrected,
and generally made ready for use in the printing-office.</p>

<p>In the first place, the plate is trimmed at the
edges, and planed in a planing-machine, which
shaves off, from the back, strips of the rough lead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
It is beveled also; that is, the edges are shaved
down in the left hand of the three smaller machines
shown in this picture: the object of the beveling is
to secure the plate afterward, when it comes to be
put on the press. It is also picked out: a workman
goes over the lettered surface with a sharp
tool, clearing out letters which have accidentally
become filled up with lead, and correcting all inaccuracies
of form which he discovers.</p>

<div id="ip_251" class="figcenter" style="width: 282px;">
  <img src="images/i_251.jpg" width="282" height="337" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Planing and Beveling.</div></div>

<p>The man at work in this picture is planing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
back of the plate again, for the purpose of getting
the requisite thickness. The knife in this plane
makes one shaving of lead, which rolls up as it
leaves the plate, like any fine shaving. To take
off another shaving, a piece of pasteboard is placed
under the plate, by which it is raised a trifle higher,
and so again brought under the knife.</p>

<div id="ip_252" class="figcenter" style="width: 288px;">
  <img src="images/i_252.jpg" width="288" height="342" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Correcting Stereotype Plates.</div></div>

<p>A proof is taken on a common hand-press, and
with this proof before him the corrector marks such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
letters as were overlooked when the plate was
picked out. This proof goes into the proof-reader’s
room again, who now goes once more over the page,
to see if everything is right; and after he has
marked it, back it goes to the corrector, who now,
with the printed proof-sheet before him, makes the
corrections that are required. If, for instance, a letter
is set up wrong, as <em>pan</em> for <em>pen</em>, and has been
overlooked by the proof-reader, and the plate is cast,
what is to be done?</p>

<p>The corrector takes a sharp tool, and punches a
hole through the plate where the interloper is, just
the size of the type, and then restoring a common
type <em>e</em>, through the opening, cuts it off even at the
back of the plate, and solders it in its place with lead.
In this way a whole line of type is sometimes introduced
for an incorrect line in the plate. The corrections
being made, the plate is ready for the press.
When not in use, the plates, being very valuable,
are carefully put in a box,&mdash;a large book requiring
several boxes. They are stored in fire-proof safes,
made for this purpose.</p>

<p>While books are generally stereotyped, woodcuts
are always electrotyped. Instead of being
moulded in plaster, the cut or illustrated page goes
into the electrotype room, to be moulded in wax.</p>

<div id="ip_253" class="figcenter" style="width: 288px;">
  <img src="images/i_254.jpg" width="288" height="343" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Moulding in Wax.</div></div>

<p>Let us look at the process.</p>

<p>A brass case, or very shallow, oblong pan is filled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
with liquid beeswax, which stands until it has
hardened. The form containing the pages of type,
well covered with fine black lead, is placed upon
the bed of the press, shown in the picture; the face
of the type is uppermost. There is an upper bed,
which in the picture is swung half-way back. This
is swung all the way back, and upon it is secured
the brass case of wax. When the upper bed is
brought back again, the wax face will of course be
downward, and thus will be ready to receive an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
impression from the form of type resting on the
lower bed; this lower bed is movable, and is gently
raised by a screw until it presses into the wax,
after the press is tightened, and now the soft wax
receives the exact impression of the type; and the
upper bed being swung back, the brass case, with
its wax mould, is removed. We have got just as
far, in fact, as when the plaster in stereotyping was
ready to receive the casting. In the battery, a corner
of which is seen in the picture, are hung one,
two, three, or more copper plates; and from rods
running parallel are hung the cases containing the
wax moulds, one being hung on either side of the
brass plate facing it. The positive pole is attached
to the case, the negative to the copper plate; and
the connection being made, a thin film of copper
appears on the surface of the mould. This coating
increases the longer the mould remains in the battery.
After ten or twelve hours it is removed, and
the result is a shell, as it is called, of the thickness
of thin pasteboard, the upper surface a perfect <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">fac
simile</i> of the original page of type or wood-cut,
every line, and every imperfection too, being reproduced.
The under surface is exactly parallel; for
each projection on the upper surface there is an indentation
in the lower.</p>

<div id="ip_255" class="figcenter" style="width: 288px;">
  <img src="images/i_256.jpg" width="288" height="342" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">The “Guillotine.”</div></div>

<p>This thin shell of copper can be bent and crumpled
up; it could not be used for printing in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
present state, and it passes through a process called
“backing up.” A thin coating of tin is applied to
the back, when it is put face downward in a shallow
dish, and kept in place by a number of small elastic
rods. Then it is hung over a flat cauldron filled
with melted type-metal, and lowered to rest in it.
When the plate has acquired the same degree of
temperature as the metal, the latter is ladled and
poured over the plate, filling up all the hollows and
indentations, and forming a solid back of lead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
The coating of tin is first applied, as lead will not
adhere to copper.</p>

<p>The plate, being now ready for the planing, beveling,
picking, and correcting of stereotype plates,
goes through the same process that we have before
described.</p>

<p>When a book is to be bound, the pile of sheets
which form it is made even at the back, and a saw,
working by steam, cuts shallow grooves across the
back, for the twine over which the sewing is done.
Two girls are pictured sewing at their frames,&mdash;passing
the needle through the fold of the sheet
and round the upright twine, adding one sheet at a
time to the pile, until the entire book is sewed.
In the large apartment called the forwarding-room,
the remaining processes of finishing are done.
The rough and uncut edges of the book are made
smooth by means of a cutting machine called the
“guillotine.”</p>

<p>The edges of a number of books can be cut at a
time, by being secured on a movable bed, which
rises so as to bring them under a stationary knife,
which cuts them smoothly as they are pressed
against it.</p>

<p>There is also a backing-machine, for rounding the
backs of books. The book is placed in a vise, and
held near the edge of the back; and the man, working
a treadle, moves a heavy roller over the back,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
thus drawing up the sheets in the centre; this is
that the cover may be made fast to the book, the
sides of the cover fitting tightly; the limp back is
like a hinge. The stiff pasteboard covers are made
by themselves; for instance, if a thousand copies
of a book are to be made, while the folding and
sewing of the thousand books is going on in one
part of the building, in another two or three men
are at work making cases; and when each is finished,
they are put together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
But the stamped name on the back or ornamental
work is done on the cases, after they are
covered with cloth, and before the books are fastened
into them. A brass die, or brand, is made of
the title of the book; then the covers which are to
be stamped are taken by the gilders, who first rub
the white of an egg over the surface to be stamped,
and upon that lay thin gold leaf, of gossamer lightness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
In the picture three girls are laying on the gold
leaf with their pallet knives.</p>

<p>The covers are now ready to be stamped by the
brass die, and that is put in place in the embossing
press, seen behind the gilders. It is kept constantly
heated, and is attached to the upper part
of the press with its face down; the cases are
slipped singly into the press, and pressed up against
the die, the letters of which stamp the gold into
the cloth; the rest of the gold is carefully rubbed
off, and collected and preserved.</p>

<p>When the edges of the leaves are to be gilded,
it is done by holding the books firmly in a vise, as
seen in the cut, the gold leaf being laid on with a
pallet knife; after which the surface is polished.</p>

<p>The workman is seen polishing the edges with
an agate burnisher. The sheets having been
pasted in their cases, and thoroughly subjected to a
powerful press, are packed and put into the trade.</p>

  <img src="images/i_261.jpg" width="283" height="336" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Marbling.</div></div>

<p>Another very curious process is marbling the
edges of leaves.</p>

<p>In the engraving is a long trough, in which is a
thin mixture of water and gum tragacanth, over
which the workman holds two dictionaries in his
hands. The colors which combine in the marbling
are water-colors, and are distributed in the seven
jars with brushes. The marbler shakes one of
these brushes over the vat, the color falling is held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
on the surface by the glue, and little circles of blue,
or whatever was dropped, are scattered over the
water; with another brush he sprinkles in the same
way, and so on for any number of colors, producing
effects as gorgeous as the mingling colors of autumn
leaves or of sunset clouds. If a piece of
paper now were dipped into the trough, it would,
when removed, be mottled or marbled. The marbling
is elongated or streaked by slowly passing a
coarse rake through the water. The marbler, taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
two books, dips the edges into the trough; the
gum causes the colors to adhere to the paper, and
the precise pattern in the vat is elegantly painted
on the book; the next is dipped in a different place,
and when the surface has been taken up, the scum
is skimmed off, and the colors again sprinkled on
the water, and the process repeated as long as required.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> have already referred to the earliest modes
of taking the impression from the types by
friction, or the rubbing of some hard smooth substance
over the paper when laid upon the face of
the types.</p>

<p>The hand-press invented by Gutenberg is the
only machine absolutely necessary for printers. A
specimen of these rude wooden machines is the
press used by Benjamin Franklin, now in the Patent
Office at Washington. A hand-press has been
illustrated and sketched in this volume; it was operated
by two men, one attending to the inking, the
other placing the paper, and pulling on the lever to
make the impression. The first improvement on
this press was made by Earl Stanhope in 1815.
He built the whole of iron, and, substituting for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the screw an obtuse-angled jointed lever, greatly
lessened the labor of the pressman. He also enlarged
the platen to the size of the bed, so that a
full sheet could be printed by one pressure of the
platen, instead of two, as in the old press. A second
improvement was soon made by G. Clymer of
Philadelphia, who in his elegant iron press, the Columbian,
used a combination of levers; in some
points it is still unsurpassed. For country papers of
limited circulation, the hand-press is still in use;
it is also a favorite in book offices for work of delicate
execution. It is now common to print by hand
two hundred and fifty impressions per hour, or one
hundred and twenty-five perfected sheets.</p>

<p>Near the end of the eighteenth century, the hand-press
proving too slow for the demands of speed and
economy, the ready intellect of inventors began
upon the problem of moving presses by power.
William Nicholson patented in England, in 1790,
a plan for a press in which the types were adjusted
upon a revolving cylinder, and were inked by contact
with another cylinder having rotary motion.
The ink was distributed by means of several inking
rollers, the last of which was fed by the ink fountain.
A large cylinder covered with felt, revolving
in contact with the first, produced the impression,
which was thus made by rolling the sheets of paper
between the cylinders. Nicholson failed in fixing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
the types to the cylinder; but had he been able to
do this, his plan of inking would not have been
practicable, as the gelatine rollers were not then
invented. Frederick Hoenig, a Saxon, so improved
this press of Nicholson as to make it a mighty engine.
Himself and another machinist, A.&nbsp;F. Bauer,
found that the way to make a bed of type work
rapidly was to effect the pressure with a cylinder
instead of a flat surface. A machine was secretly
built; and on the morning of November 28, 1814,
the “London Times” informed its readers that
they were reading a sheet printed by steam, in
these glowing <span class="locked">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Our journal of this day presents to the public
the practical result of the greatest improvement
connected with the practice of printing since the
discovery of the art itself. The reader of this paragraph
now holds in his hand one of the many thousand
impressions of the ‘Times’ newspaper which
were taken off last night by a mechanical apparatus.
A system of machinery almost organic has
been devised and arranged, which, while it relieves
the human mind and frame of its most laborious
efforts in printing, far exceeds all human powers in
rapidity and dispatch. That the magnitude of the
invention may be justly estimated by its results, we
shall inform the public, that after the letters are
placed by the compositor, and inclosed in what is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
called the form, little remains for man to do save to
attend upon and watch this unconscious agent in
its operations. The machine is then merely supplied
with paper; itself places the form, inks it, adjusts
the paper to the form newly inked, stamps
the sheet, and gives it forth to the hands of the
attendant; at the same time withdrawing the form
for a fresh coat of ink, which itself again distributes,
to meet the ensuing sheet now advancing for impression;
and the whole of these complicated acts
is performed with such a velocity and simultaneousness
of movement, that no less than 1,100 sheets
are impressed in one hour.”</p>

<p>The line of success was inaugurated; and ten
years later, the same paper says, “In consequence
of successive improvements suggested and planned
by Mr. Hoenig, the inventor, our machines now
print 2,000 per hour with more ease than 1,100 in
their original state.”</p>

<p>By successive improvements made in this machine
by Messrs. Applegath &amp; Cowper, at length,
in 1852, it could produce 11,000 impressions per
hour.</p>

<p>Isaac Adams, of Boston, succeeded in making
hand-presses work by power, and issued patents
of different machines in 1830 and in 1836. The
capacity of working slow for fine work, or rapidly
for newspaper printing, characterized these presses,
and made them favorites with printers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
It was reserved for an American, Richard M.
Hoe, of New York, to make the first successful
type-revolving press. After several costly unsuccessful
attempts, in 1847 he produced a perfect machine,
on the cylinder of which the types are held
by friction, between beveled column-rules. This
is styled the Lightning Press, and is in use throughout
the world, where rapid printing is required.</p>

<p>Recently a new press, the Bullock, is spoken of
as entering the lists with the Lightning Press. “It
feeds itself from a roll of paper, cutting it into
sheets, which are printed on both sides, and delivered
in an even pile.” Its future success or
failure must decide its place in history.</p>

<p>It will be kept in mind that there are four things
necessary in printing,&mdash;the page of type, or the
stereotype or electrotype plate, to print from; the
paper, to receive the impression; the ink, to exhibit
this impression; and lastly the printing-press
to press the paper upon the inked plate.</p>

<p>In our walk over the printing-house, let us step
into the Press-room where book-work is done.</p>

<p>On the left, in the foreground, is a large cylinder
press used for printing newspapers; there is another
in the distance, and between can be seen
parts of a number of hand-presses. On the right
are great “platen” presses, that are kept in motion
by steam-power. They are used for the nice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
execution of book-work, and print only from six
hundred to one thousand impressions an hour.</p>

<p>Let us watch the operation of one of these platen
presses on the right. The paper, having been
dampened and pressed, is laid on an inclined table
on the press, from which the “feeder,” as the girl
by the second press in the picture is called, takes
one sheet at a time, and places it upon an opposite
inclined table, where it is clutched by the iron fingers
of the press, and carried into the machine.
If we stood near the press, we should see the bed
of type adjusted with the face up, and long rollers
brought quickly back and forth, evenly smearing
it with ink. The iron fingers before mentioned as
having grasped the edge of the sheet, lay it on
the inked bed of type, where it comes under the
platen, when the bed is raised up against the paper;
the bed falling again, the force of the machine
slides out the paper over rollers upon a light frame,
which throws it over upon a board where the pile
of sheets collects. This process prints the paper on
one side only; turning the paper, the sheets are
put through the press the second time, and the
printing is completed.</p>

<p>But this and other departments of the art here
pursued, give employment to hundreds of operatives
of both sexes, throwing off annually many millions
of impressions. Here rumbles the thunder of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
modern steam-propelled printing-presses. What a
clangor is made by the simultaneous revolutions of
so much complicated machinery! Broad leather
straps, rapidly revolving in every direction, cause
you to start back, fearful lest you be caught in their
toils. And yet how docile, how easily managed,
how orderly, how almost human in intelligence,&mdash;and
with what lightning swiftness the monster
steam-presses throw off their work, so that the
eye can scarcely follow the successively printed
sheets!</p>

<p>In the adjoining Stock-room, some two days before
being printed, the paper is “wet down,” or
dampened with water, and then put under powerful
screw pressure of many tons’ weight, that the sheets
in the process of printing may take a clear impression
from the inked type. The paper, damp from
the printing-press, is then taken on trucks and by
an elevator to the Drying-room, and dried, that it
may not tear or the printing be defaced. In the
ceiling are immense frames with cross-bars, and
hanging on the latter are the printed sheets drying.
There is also a steam closet to be used during
damp weather, and when it is required to dry
the sheets quickly. Steam-pipes circulate in the
closet, by means of which a high temperature is
attained, and “no postponement on account of the
weather.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Workmen are busy bringing in the printed sheets,
and hanging them to dry, and removing those that
are dried. The thorough drying of the printed
sheets is most important.</p>

  <div class="caption">Dry-press Room.</div></div>

<p>The three work-people seen in the corner of the
Dry-press room, are engaged in laying the paper in
piles, with a piece of stiff, highly polished pasteboard,
of the size of the sheet, placed between them. The
pressure upon this pasteboard flat-iron is to be given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
by the hydraulic press. The sheets are placed in
piles on trucks, that move upon a little railroad, by
which they are conducted to the hydraulic presses,
some of which are seen at the right of the picture,
packed with sheets. Here they are put under
powerful screw pressure of from one hundred to
four hundred tons, and come out not only much
dryer, but ironed smooth of wrinkles, and the indentations
made by the type. Next, the pasteboard is
removed, and the piles of sheets sent into the Folding-room
to be folded.</p>

  <div class="caption">FOLDING, GATHERING, AND SEWING ROOM.</div></div>

<p>It is interesting to mark some of the avenues of
employment that printing has opened to women.
The working force in this room is composed almost
entirely of girls. Standing by the one at the
right hand in the foreground, let us watch her
rapid motions! With her simple paper-folder she
skillfully folds each sheet once, and smooths the
fold, then with like expertness folds this doubled
sheet again, and firmly smooths the thicker fold
with the ever-in-hand paper-folder; and once more
she folds the compact sheet into one having eight
thicknesses, or sixteen pages. This is book folding,
and she is guided by the numbers at the corners of
the pages, or <em>folios</em>&mdash;if these numbers meet, the
folding is sure to be exact. In an adjacent room is
that ingenious aid of modern printing&mdash;a rapid and
dexterous folding-machine, which, had it been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
at work in Gutenberg’s office at Strasbourg,
would have been proof additional that he dealt in
witchcraft.</p>

<p>But to return to our lady folders and their work.
The sheets, as fast as they are folded, are arranged
in piles upon the table, the girl who gathers the
sheets together into separate books following the
order of the <em>signatures</em>, or figures on the first page
of each sheet.</p>

<p>At the left of our picture, near the middle of the
room, is seen a gatherer, who is engaged in making
up “Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary.” She is in
a narrow isle between two tables, joined at the foot
by a short one. On these three tables one half of
the Dictionary is spread out at a time, in one hundred
and fifteen piles of sheets. She walks down
this isle picking a sheet off each pile, and when she
has gone the entire round she has gathered one half
of the book. When these piles are all gathered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
the other half of the book is arranged, and gathered
in the same way.</p>

<p>Next, the sheets of the book are put into the
stabbing-machine, that three holes may be made at
the inner edge, when the sheets are stitched together
by hand.</p>

<p>The backs of magazines are covered with a strong
paste, and the covers are then put on.</p>

<p>The elevator machinery connecting with each
story, of a capacity for lifting two tons, worthily
facilitates the immense work of the establishment,
as with colossal strength it lifts great burdens of
paper, type, machinery, and deposits them on just
the floor where they are needed.</p>

<p>If the first printers could revisit the earth,
with what interest would they make the tour of a
modern printing-office! How would they call to
mind their own narrow quarters, poor facilities,
and creeping progress, contrasting them with the
convenience, system, swiftness, finish, and grand
results of to-day, in the now beautifully moulded
and polished metal types, the success seemingly
gained in setting type by machinery, and the comprehensive
arrangements, of various perfected departments,
all brought under the easy control of
human skill! How unlike their own embryotic
efforts “which gave to themselves fame, their art
an existence, and civilization its motive power!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
The first introduction of printing into America
was in Mexico, by the Jesuits, who issued a
“Manual for Adults,” in 1540. The first printing-office
in America was established in Cambridge,
Mass., in 1638; the first book printed was the
“Bay Psalm-Book,” in 1640; the first newspaper
was the “Boston News Letter,” published April
24, 1704.</p>

<p>The first attempt made to print books for the
blind was made by the Abbe Hauy, at Paris, in
1785. The letters were so large, however, the
paper so thick, and the books so bulky and expensive,
that they were of little practical use. No improvement
had been made upon this system, so late
as 1830, when the Paris press was still lumbering
on in the old method. A few years later a French
author, a teacher of the Paris school for the blind,
writes, “The Americans have effected a revolution
in the art of printing for the blind.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. S.&nbsp;P. Ruggles, the well-known inventor,
who, by his genius and untiring industry,
wrought this great change. He first turned his
attention to the education of the blind in 1835 at
the Perkins Institute, in Boston. For years he
closely studied their wants and capabilities by
constant daily observation of the pupils. Books
were the first thing required; the few made being
so cumbersome and costly as scarcely to be available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
In the emergency which calls for a hero, one is
provided; and it is worthy of record that this man,
to supply the famishing intellect of the blind, clambered
up step by step the rugged height which
Gutenberg had scaled, to give light to the seeing
world.</p>

<p>After many experiments, he became convinced
that he could produce a type of less size, and less
height of face, which the blind could read with the
greatest facility; providing the raised impression
was hard and sharp, and the angles of the type
adapted to the touch of the fingers. He finally
succeeded in reducing the size of the type and the
height of its face so as to place books, of comparatively
small dimensions, in the hands of blind
students and pupils. The size of the type now in
use, the height, and peculiar bevel of its face, are
his invention.</p>

<p>He next devised and built the first press ever
made for printing for the blind. This was a very
powerful machine, giving an impression of about
three hundred tons to each sheet impressed, yet so
contrived that the blind could do their own printing.</p>

<p>After succeeding in the making of the new kind
of type, and in the construction of the ponderous
press for printing, he was met by an unexpected
difficulty. There was no paper in the market<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
adapted to this kind of printing or embossing.
That which was hard enough would crack and
break through when printed; and that which was
flexible enough not to crack, would flatten down
when pressed upon by the fingers of the pupils
when reading. His reduced type required a new
kind of paper. The peculiar and definite bevel,
and height of face of the type, and the texture
of the paper printed on, were most intimately
connected, and it took a long series of trials, in the
manufacture of paper, to get them so harmonized
as to work well together. But at last, after many
experiments with gums and gelatine, he produced
the article required.</p>

<p>His new method of making books being perfected,
Mr. Ruggles next invented an entirely new map
for the blind. It was made with a raised character,
similar to his type; but arranged with such combinations
that, at a trifling cost, he could produce a
succession of maps of any size. Maps made in this
way were never before known, and the Perkins
Institute immediately issued, from this plan, an
“Atlas” of the United States, and also a “General
Atlas.” It would, by most persons, be thought impossible
that separate type could be so contrived as
to admit of their being arranged in such a manner
as to produce a map of any country and then to use
the same type to make a map of any other country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Yet all this was perfectly accomplished by this new
invention&mdash;every piece of type matching its neighbor
with miraculous cunning, while following the
crooked lines and angles, or graceful curves of
rivers, coasts, and islands, with which such works
abound.</p>

<p>He next produced the plates for a book on
geometry, on a plan similar to his maps. These
works proved very valuable and interesting to the
blind&mdash;for with them they could pursue their
studies without the assistance from seeing persons,
which, before this, was necessary.</p>

<p>In 1838 this gentleman went to Philadelphia, and
established one of his powerful presses for printing
for the blind in the Institution in that city; and a
year or two later placed another press in the Institution
for the Blind in the State of Virginia. The
perfect success of his method for reducing the size
and expense of books for the blind, inaugurated a
new era in the history of this kind of work, and the
books were rapidly multiplied throughout this country
and Europe.</p>

<p>On the opposite page is given a specimen of the
types referred to, and which are now used for printing
for the blind: the face, or white part of these
letters, being raised in their books about one fortieth
part of an inch above the surface of the paper.</p>

<p>Steel-plate and copper-plate printing, together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
with the lithographic process, are modern inventions;
but our limits confine us to glance only at a
part of the processes used in the preparation of
books.</p>

<p>An illustration of the perfection to which the art
of printing has been brought, was given in the
printing of the catalogues of the great Exhibition
of 1851. The Exhibition opened on the first of
May; yet with all the speed that could be made, it
was not till midnight of the 30th that the catalogue,
a closely printed volume, was ready to go to press.
By the next morning, however, a bound copy was
presented to Queen Victoria. Twelve trades were
necessary for the production of this catalogue.
And so large an edition was issued that thirty-seven
tons of new type were employed, of which amount
twelve tons were manufactured in the short space
of six weeks! Twenty-seven thousand reams of
paper were used, while the ink required for the
small catalogue alone amounted to 4,000 pounds.
Specimens of typography were also exhibited from
the imperial printing-house of Vienna at this Exhibition.
About 500,000 sheets, or 1,000 reams, of
paper per day are required for the consumption of
that establishment.</p>

<p>A French paper makes a calculation to show
how marvelously human labor is outrivaled by the
mechanical arrangements of the steam press. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
paper, “La Patrie,” contains about 4,230 lines:
8,000 copies make 34,560,000 lines. A clerk could
write about three lines in a minute; therefore it
would require 11,520,000 minutes, or 192,000
hours, for a single clerk to supply 8,000 copies of
“La Patrie;” in other words, it would require
192,000 men to supply, by copying, the same
amount of paper which the cylinder printing-press
supplies in one hour.</p>

<p>What great armies of compositors are at work in
the printing-houses of Christendom! What numberless
presses by night and by day throw off multitudinous
papers, pamphlets, and books, which are
scattered to every home, business mart, and travelling
conveyance in the land.</p>

<p>At the Great Exhibition one Bible Society alone
had specimens of the Word of God printed in one
hundred and twenty different languages. And a
single religious publishing society of London, as
early as 1862, had issued five hundred and seventy-six
millions of copies of its publications. But that
is only one of many societies of similar character,
and moreover, every enlightened nation abounds in
book and periodical publishers and booksellers.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> the “undevout astronomer is mad,” what shall
be thought of the unbelieving observer of God’s
dealings with the human race? If evidences of infinite
design appear in the material bodies that people
space, can we think that God has stamped his
creating, ordering hand less distinctly on the affairs
connected with the progress of the souls for whom
all things exist? The needle pointing to the pole
helps on navigation; it is the servant of the seamen:
without it, what would commerce do? But
how happened it that the principle of the mariner’s
compass was discovered just when in the turmoil
of events it would be most useful&mdash;when it could
suitably and most effectively introduce the old to
the new world? How providential, too, the time
of the invention of the art of printing! Had it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
been much earlier, the materials for writing were
so scarce that it must have come to naught. Had
it been deferred, doubtless many works which we
prize as among the most valuable and excellent
would have been lost. In less than a half-century
from the invention of the wonderful art, the continent
of America was discovered by Columbus, in
1492. In less then a century, Copernicus discovered
the true theory of the planetary motions;
and, shortly after, only a few years intervening,
he was succeeded by the three great heralds of
Newton,&mdash;Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and Galileo.</p>

<p>Man is above nature. The senses only, do not
constitute man; for the brutes have some senses
like us, and, not seldom, stronger, more delicate,
more subtile, quicker to act, more infallible. It is
<em>thought</em>, then, that gives man the preëminence.
But what if thought could never be expressed?
What if the members of the human race could
never discover thought to each other, never reveal
what passed within the mysterious and mighty laboratory
of the mind only as the infant seeks to make
its wants known, by gestures and moans and “inarticulate
cries?” But the Creator gave man
speech; God’s first grand interposition for the soul
was the gift of speech! “We believe,” says a
brilliant French writer, “that speech was not born
of itself on the lips of primitive man,” as some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
affirm, “like a stammering of chance, attaching,
from age to age, certain vague significations to certain
inarticulated sounds, and giving to others, by
the sound and connection of these human cries,
lessons which he who uttered them had not himself
received. To reach thence from these instinctive
cries to speech; from speech to the unanimous
agreement of the meaning of words&mdash;of the sense
of certain words to the verb and phrase&mdash;of the
verb and phrase to logical syntax&mdash;of this syntax
to the language of Moses, David, Cicero, Confucius,
Racine, it is necessary to suppose more ages of existence
to the human race on this earthly globe than
there are stars, visible and invisible, in the Milky
Way. It is necessary to suppose numberless ages
of stupidity during which the human race, essentially
moral and intellectual, should vainly search,
like the brutes, its <em>instrument</em> of morality and
knowledge, without power to find it only after
myriads of generations. Humanity deaf and mute
during a hundred thousand years! I shudder at
the blasphemy of believing such a mystery. I love
better to believe in the other; that is to say, in the
fatherly mystery of the Creator himself, inspiring
on the lips of his infant creature, speech; the word,
the sentence, the inborn expression, which at sight
gave things names appropriate to their form and
nature.”</p>

And when we consider how necessary the use of
language is to the convenience, comfort, and progress
of man, and that man had at once conferred
upon him a body “curiously and wonderfully
made,” and a mind capacious, active, strong, and
penetrating, can we harbor the idea that after his
creation, God left him,&mdash;a perfect, full-grown being,
the noblest of his works, and the lord of nature,&mdash;without
speech? Rather must we not infer, with a
distinguished writer, that “the same Divine Author
of the physical organs of speech imparted to man
the knowledge of their use and power”?</p>

<p>But speech carries thought from the mouth to the
ear by sound, and then perishes like the medium
which conveyed it there. There needed to be,
therefore, a process to <em>preserve</em> thought, by reducing
it to material signs on some enduring substance.
So writing was given to the world. And the
wonderful discovery of alphabetical writing, how
did it come about? By chance? by human ingenuity?
or through the “fatherly mystery of the
Creator inspiring it” in man? Says the learned
Shackford, “That men should immediately fall on
such a project, to express sounds by letters, and
expose to sight all that may be said or thought in
about twenty characters variously placed, exceeds
the highest notions we can have of the capacities
with which we are endowed.” How difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
submit our reason to the theories which have been
argued of a <em>gradual</em> construction of alphabetical
letters! Is it reasonable to suppose, for example,
that the old Shemitish letter D was suggested by
the word <em>door</em>, or the letter H by the word <em>fence</em>,
and the V by a <em>hook</em> or <em>nail</em>? Do we not find
evidence, that alphabetical writing was divinely
revealed, in the tables of stone written by the
finger of God and given to Moses on the Mount?
In those ten commandments so anciently bestowed,
all the Hebrew letters, with one exception, are
found&mdash;every guttural, labial, lingual, and dental is
disclosed. Some quote the Chinese as leading the
way in imprinting language. But their writing was
hieroglyphical, they did not reach alphabetical writing,
and they use one hundred and twenty thousand
characters to express thought.</p>

<p>But whether writing, which has well been
spoken of as “nearly divine,” is the invention of
man, or is truly divine in its origin, its possession
was a great step in human progress. By it speech
became enduring and universal; it could be preserved,
it could be diffused. Poetry, history,
science, law, art, religion, thus found expression for
all time. Through it we commune with the thinkers
of antiquity. By its aid “the Book” has
come down to us. Nevertheless, this mode of
transmitting knowledge was slow, toilsome, costly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
and not available to the masses. At the beginning
of the eleventh century, for example, books were
so scarce in Spain that one and the same copy of
the Bible, St. Jerome’s Epistles, and some volumes
of ecclesiastical offices, served several different
monasteries. Books were the privilege of the
wealthy and the powerful; and the common people
had them not. “The head of society was in the
light, the feet in the shade,” and “the progress of
truth, science, letters, politics, arts, was slow, and
suspended through long periods.” Some process
was needed by which the written thoughts of the
thinkers could be reproduced with greater rapidity,
and thus placed within the reach even of the poor.
This, John Gutenberg, in the good providence of
God, gave mankind, in the discovery of printing.
With the new art came a new era for the world.
In a few years after Gutenberg’s death all the capitals
of Europe had their printing-presses. France,
England, Holland, Germany, Venice, Genoa, Rome,
Poland, seized the invention, and spread abroad
religious and secular works. In 1500 the Jews
published tracts on Rabbinical literature in Constantinople.
And Russia, in 1680, established a
press in Moscow.</p>

<p>The invention had its enemies, and printing its
martyrs; but its glory could not be dimmed, nor its
progress arrested. Kings and queens turned engravers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
and compositors, glorying to labor with
their own hands in the wonderful art. The wife of
Henry IV. designed and printed cuts for some
royal publications, and engraving with her own
hand a figure of a young girl, presented it to
“Philip de Champagne.” Louis XV. in his youth,
printed in his own palace a “Treatise on European
Geography.” The chief printers of the times succeeding
that of Gutenberg were often the artists,
the learned men, the writers. They not only reproduced
the buried works of antiquity, but were
able to explain and interpret them.</p>

<p>The Emperor Maximilian ennobled the printers
and compositors of the new art, authorizing them to
wear robes braided with gold and silver, such as
the nobility only had the right to wear, and giving
them, for a coat of arms, an eagle with wings extended
on the globe, symbol of free and rapid flight
and universal conquest. Deserved honor! fitting
symbol! What marvels has printing wrought. It
has given elementary instruction to the masses,&mdash;putting
into every hand, however humble or toilworn,
the printed page, multiplying books to teach,
amuse, and elevate even the little child. It has
reformed corrupt religions, fashioned and developed
philosophy anew, and permeated laws with
their true spirit. Before its magic touch, the old
feudal despotisms of the dark ages have fallen, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
later and no less oppressive systems have wasted
away. By its aid time and space seem annihilated,
as “railways open to it routes, steam lends to it
wings, and the electric telegraph gives it the instantaneousness
of powder!” The “preserver of
all arts,” it broods over and perpetuates all useful
institutions and discoveries; and trade and commerce
are stimulated, guided, systematized, enlarged,
and furnished with boundless facilities. But
this mighty engine can be used for evil as well as
for good, and strike like the thunder-bolt the best
interests of man. The poet-historian from whom
we have before quoted, illustrates this by a dream
of Gutenberg’s, which he is said to have related to
his friends, and to have been translated from the
German, at Strasbourg, by Mr. Garaud.</p>

<p>Gutenberg had succeeded in an important experiment.
His success filled him with such enthusiasm
that he scarcely slept the night following.
In his troubled and imperfect rest he had his dream,&mdash;a
dream so prophetic, and so near to the truth,
that one questions, in reading it, if it be not the reflecting
presentiment of a wakeful sage rather than
the fevered dream of a slumbering artisan. This is
the account or legend of this dream as it is preserved
in the library of the counsellor Aulique <span class="locked">Beck:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In a cell of a cloister of Arbogast sits a man
with a wan forehead, a long beard, and fixed look,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
before a table, supporting his head with his hand.
Suddenly he passes his fingers through his beard
with a quick joyous movement&mdash;the hermit of the
cell has discovered a solution of the problem he
sought! He rises and utters a cry; it was as a relief
to a long pent-up thought. He hastily turns to his
trunk, opens it, and takes therefrom a cutting instrument;
then, with nervous jerking movements,
he sets himself to carve a small piece of wood. In
all these movements there was joy and anxiety, as
if he feared that his idea would escape,&mdash;the diamond
he had found, and which he wished to set
and polish for posterity. Gutenberg cut roughly
and with feverish activity, his brow covered with
drops of sweat, while his eyes followed with ardor
the progress of his work. He wrought thus a great
while, but the time seemed short. At length, he
dipped the wood in a black liquid, placed it on
parchment, and bearing the weight of his body on
his hand in the manner of a press, he printed the
first letter which he had cut, in relief. He contemplated
the result, and a second cry, full of the
ecstasy of satisfied genius, burst from his lips; then
he closed his eyes with an air of happiness such as
would befit the saints in paradise, and fell exhausted
on a joint-stool; when overcome of sleep, he murmured,
‘I am immortal!’</p>

<p>“Then he had a dream which troubled him. ‘I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
heard two voices,’ said he, in relating it; ‘two unknown
and of a different sound, which spoke alternately
in my soul. One said to me, “Rejoice, John;
thou art immortal! Henceforth, light shall be
spread by thee throughout the world. People who
dwell a thousand leagues from thee, strangers to
the thoughts of our country, shall read and comprehend
all the ideas now mute,&mdash;spread and multiplied
as the reverberations of the thunder, by thee,
by thy work. Rejoice, thou art immortal! for thou
art the interpreter whom the nations await that
they may converse together. Thou art immortal;
for thy discovery comes to give perpetual life to the
genius which would be still-born without thee, and
who, by acknowledgment, shall all make known in
their turn the immortality of him who immortalized
them!” The voice ceased, and left me in the delirium
of glory. But I heard another voice. It said
to me, “Yes, John, thou art immortal. But at
what a price? Thought not unlike thine, is it always
pure and holy enough to be worthy of being
delivered to the ears and eyes of the human race?
Are there not many&mdash;the greater number it may
be&mdash;which merit rather a thousand times to be annihilated,
and sink to oblivion, than to be repeated and
multiplied in the world? Man is oftener perverse
than wise and good; he will profane the gift that
you make him; he will abuse the new faculty that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
you create for him. More of the world, in place of
blessing, will curse thee. Some men will be born
with souls powerful and seductive, and hearts proud
and corrupt. Without thee, they would rest in the
shade; shut in a narrow circle, they would be known
only to their associates, and during their lives. By
thee, they will bear folly, mischief, and crime to all
men and all ages. See thousands corrupted with
the disease of one! See young men depraved by
books whose pages distill soul-poison! See young
women become immodest, false, and hard to the
poor, by books which have poisoned their hearts!
See mothers mourning their sons! See fathers
blushing for their daughters! Is not immortality
too dear which costs so many tears and such anguish?
Dost thou desire glory at such a price?
Art thou not appalled at the responsibility with
which this glory will weigh down thy soul? Listen
to me, John: live as if thou hadst discovered
nothing. Regard thy invention as a seductive but
fatal dream, whose execution would be useful and
holy, if only man was good. But man is evil.
And in lending arms to the evil, art thou not a participator
in his crimes?”</p>

<p>“‘I awoke in a horror of doubt! I hesitated an
instant; but I considered that the gifts of God,
though they were sometimes very perilous, were
never bad, and that to give an instrument to aid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
reason, and advance human liberty, was to give a
vaster field to intelligence and to virtue,&mdash;both
divine. I pursued the execution of my discovery.’”</p>

<p>Thus has the art of printing come down to us
consecrated by the martyr struggles of a heroic soul.
He died poor, able only to leave a few books to his
loving sister, yet enriching all mankind by the fruits
of his genius. “I bequeath to my sister,” said he
in his will, “all the books printed by me in Strasbourg.”</p>

<p>But which of the voices that the legend represents
as speaking to Gutenberg in his dream, shall
prove a true prophet of the art? Shall its resistless
power blast the world with error and crime,
or bless the ages with truth and purity? “The
first cries of the press,” says a historian, “were
praise and prayer.” Let its utterances be for religion
and learning, God and humanity; then welcome
the hour when the earth shall be covered with
its swiftly multiplying issues, “the leaves of the
tree which are for the healing of the nations.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
